The article discusses the potential of digital tapes, particularly DAT, to securely encrypt and hide large amounts of information, leading to wholly anonymous transactions. The advent of encryption technology and its widespread use poses a threat to the current corporate monopoly on expertise and proprietary knowledge. The military currently has a monopoly on encryption knowledge, and very little technology has trickled down for civilian use. Encryption has become an essential tool for securing the highly decentralized network of networks that has emerged in recent years. The article discusses the efforts of a group of amateur crypto-hackers who interact through the Cypherpunk electronic mailing list to implement ideas on the cheap and discuss the ethical and political implications of their work. The cypherpunks aim to provide free digital signatures and online anonymity through the development of anonymous re-mailers. Digital pseudonymity is also seen as a way to decrease costs and increase access to information. The cypherpunks aim to use the Fax Effect to increase the value of encryption by making it more widely available. The article discusses the role of encryption and digital technology in shaping politics and privacy in a network economy. It highlights the use of encryption freeware, such as PGP and RIPEM, and how they are based on RSA's patented implementation of encryption algorithms. The article discusses the challenges of preventing piracy and hacking in encrypted systems and proposes the solution of disengaging payment from duplication through crypto-metering. The article also discusses the history of metering and billing for electricity and compares it to the current lack of an information meter in the information industry. The article concludes that success in a networked world belongs to those plans that do not resist the replication or roaming urges of information. The article discusses the concepts of superdistribution, information metering, and digital cash as potential solutions to the Pay-Per-View Problem and the lack of electronic cash in the information economy. Superdistribution relies on public-key encryption to keep counts private and untampered as they are transmitted to the credit center. Information metering provides a spigot to record how much data is used and allows for the trading of items that might not have been worth selling in any other kind of marketplace. Digital cash offers privacy, as it allows merchants to receive payment without knowing the identity of the payer, and works offline, making it perfect for small transactions. The article also discusses the drawbacks of debit or credit cards and the rise of smart cards, which offer privacy and agility in transactions. David Chaum's digital cash system provides anonymous electronic money and works offline, making it perfect for small transactions, but is vulnerable to theft and loss. The Danish government is planning to switch from the Dencard to the Dencoin, an offline system suited to small change, due to its cheaper costs. The article discusses the potential for digital cash to transform the economy and society, with existing mainframe computers in banks having enough computational power to handle it. The rise of e-money could lead to the blurring of lines between legal and illegal financial activities, with the potential for underground economies and challenges to government control over currency issuance. The legality of anonymous digital cash is in limbo, but encryption technology is seen as a necessary counterforce to the Net's tendency to connect everything and everyone. The article concludes that encryption permits the requisite out-of-controlness that a hive culture demands to keep nimble and quick as it evolves into a deepening tangle.
