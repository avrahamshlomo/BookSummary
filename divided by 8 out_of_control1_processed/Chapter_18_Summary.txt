The language of evolution often emphasizes change, but not steadfastness. However, the study of evolution is becoming increasingly important as the rate of change in our world accelerates. Artificial evolution is becoming valuable to engineers, as it allows technology to change itself and promotes adaptation. Recent research suggests that when an organism acquires sufficient complexity in its body, it can use its body to teach the genes what they need to know to evolve. This mechanism is a hybrid of evolution and learning and has great potential in artificial realms. The concept of genetic assimilation, or the Baldwin effect, refers to the natural selection of traits that control the range of evolution, allowing for quicker adaptation to changing environments. Studies have shown that populations of organisms that are learning evolve faster than those that are not. Learning and behavior may be among the causes of genetic evolution. Artificial evolution may require artificial learning and intelligence to accelerate the speed of evolution. Learning plus evolution is the recipe for culture, and genes may pass their information off onto learning and behavior. The relationship between culture and biology is symbiotic, with cultural evolution driving genetic change. Lamarckian evolution, where acquired traits can be inherited, is a crucial part of this process. The evolution of evolution can be traced through six stages, culminating in the evolution of the human brain and culture. The ultimate goal of evolution is to create all possible possibilities. Evolution has become a quasi-religious postulate that shapes our understanding of human origins and has unexamined consequences that may touch our souls.
