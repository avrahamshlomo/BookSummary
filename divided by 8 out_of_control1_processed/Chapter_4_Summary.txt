The article explores the idea that the future of machines lies in biology, and that machines are becoming more alive than dead. The author visits a prairie oasis in the suburbs of Chicago and discusses the restoration efforts of ecologists to recreate a prairie ecosystem. The article emphasizes the importance of fire in prairie ecology and the role of succession in ecosystem restoration. The author also discusses the work of ecologists who experimented with creating stable ecosystems by adding different combinations of algae and microscopic animals, and who created simplified ecological models in a computer to map the frequency of system stabilization. The article suggests that life is becoming manufactured, just as the manufactured is becoming life, and that both are becoming something wonderful and strange. The article discusses the importance of understanding the assembly instructions for ecosystems in order to successfully restore them. Ecosystems can have multiple stabilities and are sensitive to initial conditions, but are usually attracted to order. The article provides examples of successful ecosystem restoration, but also highlights the potential challenges in restoring lost ecosystems due to the absence of key species. The Humpty Dumpty Effect refers to the difficulty in putting together a lost ecosystem if all the necessary pieces are not available. The growth of complex systems, whether mechanical or ecological, requires incremental and indirect approaches over time.
