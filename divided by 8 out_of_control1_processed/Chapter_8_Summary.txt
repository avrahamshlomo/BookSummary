The article discusses the creation of self-contained ecosystems, such as the synthetic South Pacific ocean at the Steinhart Aquarium and the Ecosphere, a commercial product containing brine shrimp, algae, and microbes. These ecosystems require a delicate balance of dissolved gases, trace chemicals, pH, microorganisms, light, wave action, and temperature to maintain a healthy coral reef ecosystem. The article highlights the importance of sequencing the introduction of species into an aquarium and the role of microbes in creating a stable closed ecology. The Ecosphere is a totemic bridge between the separate worlds of spirit and dreams, but without turbulence, it becomes dominated by blue-green algae. The article also discusses the concept of closed ecosystems in which a human could survive. The article discusses the use of closed ecological systems, or biospheres, to support human life in space or other isolated environments. The history and development of biospheres are explored, including the Soviet Union's Bios-3 and NASA's CELSS program. Ultra-intensive gardening was found to be a workable solution, and the Synergia Ranch commune's vision of creating a living satellite is discussed. The Biosphere 2 project, a grand experiment in creating a self-sustaining ecosystem, is described, including the challenges faced by the designers in creating a balanced ecosystem with a variety of species that would produce oxygen, food, and support each other's needs. The project aimed to test the assumption that diversity ensures stability and whether complexity could birth self-sustainability. The article discusses the construction of Biosphere 2, a synthetic ecological system designed to mimic Earth's environment, and the challenges faced by scientists in creating a functioning ecosystem. The project involved ecologists with expertise in different areas coming together to select and combine species from different biomes to create a closed ecological system with a variety of animals and plants to sustain human life. The article also explores the concept of synthetic ecology and its relevance to understanding the behavior of natural closed systems, such as the Earth as a whole. The study of synthetic ecosystems can help us better understand the impact of human influence on the unified system of life on Earth.
