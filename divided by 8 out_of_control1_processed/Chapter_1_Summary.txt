The article discusses the merging of natural and artificial systems, as machines become more biological and the biological becomes more engineered. The author argues that this convergence is becoming increasingly common and important as our human-made environment becomes more complex. The logic of the living can be extracted from biology and applied elsewhere, leading to the emergence of vivisystems. The book explores this convergence and identifies unifying principles shared by all self-sustaining, self-improving systems. The author emphasizes the importance of nature as an idea factory and a source of post-industrial paradigms. However, as living forces are introduced into machines, they become wild and uncontrollable, leading to a loss of complete sovereignty over creations. The world of the made will soon be autonomous, adaptable, and creative, but out of human control, which is seen as a positive development.
