The article discusses the Nine Laws of God, which are principles that govern the creation and sustenance of complex adaptive systems. The laws emphasize the importance of diversity, embracing errors, seeking persistent disequilibrium, and recognizing the self-changing nature of change. The article predicts a future neo-biological civilization where machines become more biological, and biological ways are revered as ideal. The text also provides a list of recommended books and articles on topics related to complex systems, their behavior, and evolution. The recommended sources cover a range of subjects including physics, math, computer science, and economics. The text is a collection of lists of recommended books and articles on various topics related to science and technology. The topics covered include complexity science, evolution, artificial intelligence, robotics, and more. The recommended works cover a range of perspectives and approaches, from technical treatises for professionals to more accessible works for general audiences. The lists provide insights into various fields and offer a diverse range of perspectives on each topic. The text presents a series of annotated bibliographies on various topics related to science and technology literature. The bibliographies cover a wide range of topics, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence, non-Darwinian evolution, computer memory architecture, and ecology. The summaries provide brief insights into the content and significance of each book, highlighting key arguments, evidence, and perspectives. The works listed include scholarly works, visionary or technical in nature, and cover topics such as natural selection, self-organization, biomass increase, peer-to-peer networks, smart houses, social networks, artificial life, cybernetics, and evolution. The bibliographies offer a glimpse into the diverse and fascinating world of science and technology literature, providing insights into the complex systems and processes that shape our world. This text is a compilation of annotated bibliographies on various topics related to systems thinking, cybernetics, and complexity. The list includes works from various authors and covers a range of topics such as evolution, biology, simulations in warfare, sensory deprivation, complexity, cybernetics, and digital culture. The author reflects on the fast-paced nature of technological advancements and how quickly ideas become outdated. The book "Out of Control" by Kevin Kelly is described as an update on the current state of cybernetic research and should be read as a part of intellectual history. The author notes that humans are always locked into the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The article discusses Kevin Kelly's book "Out of Control," which explores the intersection of technology and society. The book lacks a new holistic vision and is encyclopedic in form. The concept of "emergent realities" is discussed, with Kelly noting that it is descriptive rather than explanatory. The article also discusses Kelly's "Nine Laws of God," which present a techno-utopic vision of evolutionary and market forces. However, the article notes that there is little ethical reflection in Kelly's project. The breakdown of boundaries between the natural and the artifactual is seen as a problem and opportunity by Kelly. The author poses an antithesis to Kelly's thesis, questioning the moral constraints on creativity and the dangers of being "out of control." The article also discusses Kelly's background and his conservative personal and social morals. The article discusses the readership of WIRED, which is predominantly male with high income and education, and its relationship with Absolut Vodka, one of its loyal advertisers. It explores Kevin Kelly's "Nine Laws of God," which highlight the importance of natural creativity and swarm systems. The text argues that complex systems, such as universities and the brain, are made up of many individual parts that work together to create a functional whole. Kelly celebrates the emergence of the super hive mind of the Internet and the cashless society, advocating for technological progress. However, the author argues that technology has real repercussions in the world, and exponential growth in population and consumption patterns is unprecedented in human history. The article critiques Kevin Kelly's techno-utopic vision, arguing that it neglects the discussion of morality and is both anthropocentric and misanthropic. The article critiques Kevin Kelly's ideology of technology and nature, arguing that it lacks an appreciation for the negative effects of technology on the environment and society. The author also questions Kelly's Christian beliefs and argues for a more nuanced understanding of the distribution of goodness and evil in the world. However, the author suggests that Kelly's philosophy of nature can be turned into natural ethics that would lead to more conservative social and environmental policies. The article explores the role of humans in the world, the relationship between God's creativity and our own, and the potential implications of neo-biological evolution. The author emphasizes the importance of surrendering power and embracing creative tension in the journey towards a neo-biological civilization. The article also briefly discusses Kelly's books "Out of Control" and "New Rules for the New Economy," which explore the benefits of swarm systems and the counter-intuitive economic rules of the highly-connected network economy.
