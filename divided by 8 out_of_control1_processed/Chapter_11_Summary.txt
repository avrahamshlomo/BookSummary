The article explores the concept of networks and how they are revolutionizing the economy and altering laws and financing. It discusses the power of computers to connect us rather than think for us, and how networked intelligence is improving manufacturing, enabling remote diagnostics and maintenance of products. The article also discusses the potential for companies to become purely networked, with no single location and a collaborative, adaptive approach. The trend towards decentralization in business is being driven by the rise of networks, which allow companies to outsource peripheral functions and focus on their core competencies. However, research shows that the transactional costs needed to maintain the quality of a task as it stretches across several companies are higher than if the job stayed within one company. The article argues that outsourcing allows for increased adaptability and reduced costs, especially with the use of network technology. The article discusses the rise of collaborative networking and the shift from products to services in the business world, with companies collaborating with competitors to outsource vital functions and forming strategic alliances to create symbiotic relationships. The cost of physical reproduction of products is decreasing due to automation, but the cost of research, development, marketing, and customer support is increasing. To make money in the new era, companies must follow the flow of information and invest in networks that engender knowledge. The article also discusses the movement towards "zero-defect" software design, which borrows heavily from Shigeo Shingo's work on zero-defect manufacturing. The article discusses the concept of poka-yoke in software development, which refers to the use of techniques to prevent errors before they occur. The article concludes by highlighting that errors tend to cluster in software, making it important to use poka-yoke techniques to achieve high-quality software. The concept of zero-defect software suggests that error clustering is prevalent in software and that it is better to discard error-prone code than to try and fix it. The future of network economics will be characterized by distributed cores, flexible manufacturing, mass customization, industrial ecology, global accounting, coevolved customers, knowledge-based systems, free bandwidth, increasing returns, and digital money. Companies will become societies of work centers, and products will be individually customized but produced on a mass scale. Industrial ecology and biologically compatible techniques will be prioritized, and global accounting will be essential. Knowledge coordination will become priceless, and digital money will replace paper money. The emergence of network economics will create a neo-biological civilization and a global mind, leading to a new spiritualism and a never-ending quest to find the "I am" of the global mind. The network economy will also lead to increased decentralization and symbiotic relationships between providers and customers, with the central act being to connect everything to everything. The informal economy will boom, with creative edges and fringe areas expanding and becoming invisibly connected on encrypted networks.
