The article discusses the history and evolution of automatic control, starting from ancient Chinese inventions to the development of modern-day control systems. Ktesibios, a barber in Alexandria, invented the first truly automatic device, a water clock that self-regulated its water supply and kept accurate time. Heron, who worked in Alexandria, created a range of automatic float mechanisms, including the "Inexhaustible Goblet," which refilled itself from a pipe in its bottom. Cornelis Drebbel invented the thermostat, which maintained a constant temperature, and Watt's centrifugal governor controlled the speed of a steam engine. The development of automatic feedback loops and servomechanisms paved the way for the creation of control systems, which have become an important area of study in the field of biology. Servomechanisms are still used in updated technology to pilot boats, control airplane flaps, and remotely operate arms that handle toxic and nuclear waste. The article explores the concept of cybernetics, which was coined by mathematician Norbert Wiener and introduced the idea of feedback control. The cybernetic principle involves manipulating one variable in a system to indirectly control all variables, and it has revolutionized industry and allowed for precision in manufacturing. The article discusses the concept of spontaneous order through the use of automatic control systems and explores the emergence of self from itself, as suggested by cybernetics. The advent of automatic control has come in three stages: control of energy, control of materials, and control of information. However, the control of information has flooded our environment with unmanaged data, which is at toxic levels. The central event of the 21st century will be the subjugation of information, with genetic engineering and electronic libraries leading the way. The article discusses the one-way shift from human control to automatic control in the story of automation. It emphasizes the importance of giving machines freedom to adapt, evolve, and grow without human oversight for intelligent control. The challenge of the 21st century is to let go with dignity.
