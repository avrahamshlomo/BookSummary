The article discusses the work of Mark Pauline, an artist and inventor who creates machines for his performance art group, Survival Research Laboratories (SRL). His machines are often huge, intricate, and exude biological vibes. Pauline aims to make machines autonomous, and he is ahead of many heavily funded university labs in attempting to transfer control from humans to machines. The article argues that machines have their own complexity and purpose, and therefore deserve respect and entertainment. The ultimate goal is to create robots like Robbie the Robot from science fiction who are self-navigating and autonomous. The article concludes by contrasting the abilities of Ambler, a robot created with millions of dollars in research funding, and a tiny ant that can navigate the same courtyard without incident despite having no image of the space or a clear idea of where it is. The article also discusses the idea of building an army of small, cheap, and autonomous robots, or mobots, to explore planets instead of relying on one large, expensive robot. The article discusses the concept of "mobots" - small, disposable robots that are cheaper and faster to build than larger robots. The "fast, cheap, and out of control" philosophy challenges the slower and more in-control approach of traditional industrial designers. The article outlines the subsumption architecture approach to building complex systems, which involves starting with simple behaviors and gradually adding new layers of activity over them. This approach is applied to government structures, the human brain and body, and robots. The text argues against the idea of a centralized brain as a way to manage complexity, suggesting that intelligence without reason, constructed layer by layer from the bottom up, is a better approach. Consciousness is described as an emergent phenomenon arising from the distributed network of many feeble, unconscious circuits. The mind is a theatre of simultaneous possibilities, and consciousness consists of comparing and selecting these possibilities. The "society of mind" theory suggests that intelligence is created by many mindless parts that compete and cooperate for resources and recognition. The decentralized, distributed nature of human minds allows for the existence of Multiple Personalities Syndrome and the invention of the "I" as a shroud or ghost. Hierarchies are essential, and bottom-up, distributed control is beneficial in robotics, as seen in the juggling seeing-eye robot arm. The subsumption architecture involves decentralized control and communication through the world, similar to a market economy. Miniaturization allows for the development of small, inexpensive robots that can be used in various applications. The article discusses the idea of creating a colony of sentient entities by putting chip brains in various objects. The lesson from the Mobot Lab is that there is no mind without body in a real unforgiving world. The fantasy of a pure disembodied intelligence is just that, a fantasy, and mind transfer is not grounded in reality as bodies and minds are intertwined and decentralized. The article argues that the center of behavior is in the heart, where emotions are regulated by hormones and peptides, and that building robots that must survive in real bodies is the only way to develop artificial intelligence. The body is essential to anchor the mind and prevent it from becoming lost in its own internal circuitry, and without sensory input, the mind can become mentally blind and engage in mental masturbation. The article discusses the importance of embodiment in understanding the mind and the limitations of machines in this regard. Ray Kurzweil's book "The Age of Spiritual Machines" envisions a future where machines learn and evolve through vast populations and even suggests the possibility of a human/machine networked mind. The author suggests that humans may find spiritual wholesomeness in knowing that they are a link in a complex machine layered on top of the green life, and that machines will eventually talk back to humans, inspiring feelings of holy awe.
