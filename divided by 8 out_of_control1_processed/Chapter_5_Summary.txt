The article explores the metaphor of a chameleon on a mirror as a representation of the coevolution of a system, as explained by Gregory Bateson and Stewart Brand. The article delves into the question of whether the consumer in a marketplace settles at a middle average or oscillates in mad swings, and how feedback signals in different markets influence the production of goods. The article also discusses the difference between medieval and modern societies in terms of their relationship with mirrors and self-reflection, and the concept of causality and how it differs in the linear logic of the Western world versus the circular causality of the net. The article concludes by discussing how control in natural ecologies also dissolves into a causality horizon, where the reasons for things spread to the side like a wind, and how coevolution is prevalent in both the natural world and the business world, with symbiotic alliances becoming increasingly prevalent. Coevolution is a recursive dynamic that creates emergent, coevolutionarily wired symbiosis between organisms, leading to a network of life on Earth that transcends the life of its ingredients. James Lovelock proposed a method to check for life on planets by measuring the spectrum of a planet's atmosphere and determining its composition. The Earth's atmosphere is in a state of persistent disequilibrium due to the coevolutionary tangle of life, which keeps the chemicals of the planet off-balance, and this off-balance is balanced and stable in its own way. Russian geologist Vladimir Vernadsky was one of the first to articulate the idea that life directly shapes the physicality of the planet, calling it the "biosphere." The biosphere and all the natural phenomena on Earth are products of living organisms or have been greatly modified by their presence, according to scientists like Vernadsky, Lamarck, and Lovelock. Humans intensify life further by harnessing fossil energy and breathing life into machines, making our entire manufactured infrastructure part of a wider, global-scale life. The article discusses the concept of self-governance and self-control, which are not mystical spirits but rather mechanical processes. James Lovelock's Gaia theory proposes that the Earth is a single living entity capable of manipulating its own atmosphere, which has been critiqued for expanding the definition of life. However, Lovelock argues that Gaia is a bounded whole, and its inert, mechanistic parts are part of its life. The article discusses the concept of coevolutionary games, which are played by any kind of adaptive agent, not just humans. The games involve a fundamental tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, which every complex adaptive organization must balance. The article explores the Prisoner's Dilemma game, which was played by 14 players in a round-robin tournament on a computer. The results showed that masses of dumb agents playing Prisoner's Dilemma reenacted the ecological oscillations of fox and hare and created many other natural phenomena such as parasitism, spontaneously emerging symbiosis, and long-term stable coexistence between species. The article discusses the concept of coevolution and its application to various aspects of life, including politics, economics, and ecology. It explains that coevolution is a nonzero-sum game, where the whole can reward or cripple all members, and that pure strategies are not resilient to competing strategies, but a little randomness creates long-term stability. The article argues that control and secrecy are counterproductive in coevolutionary worlds, and that open communication and information exchange are essential for stability and growth. The collapse of Soviet command-style economies is cited as an example of the benefits of open information. The article also suggests that the Network Era is creating opportunities for emergent coevolution, self-organization, and win-win cooperation.
