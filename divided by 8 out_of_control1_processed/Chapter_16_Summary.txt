The article explores the evolution of computer animation and the potential for computer-generated creatures to have their own behavior and will. The use of physics laws to create virtual objects that behave like their real-world counterparts is discussed, as well as the use of computer programs to simulate growth and create realistic images of plants and animals. The article also discusses the role of animators in creating believable characters and the limitations of computer-generated characters. The ongoing quest for control of human facial expressions and behavior in computer-generated characters is also explored. The article concludes by suggesting that as artificial environments become more complex, they may become fertile ground for synthetic life. The article discusses the development of autonomous virtual characters in computer animations and the challenge of creating characters that can navigate, express emotion, and react in a way that is realistic and believable. To achieve this, animators and roboticists draw inspiration from ethology, the study of animal behavior, which provides a framework for understanding the logical underpinnings of character. The article also explores the potential for artificially generated behavior in the form of characters with programmed emotions and personalities, and the shift in control from creating a story to creating a world with personalities. The article concludes by discussing the development of virtual creatures in the field of artificial life research, including woggles and a system called ALIVE that allows users to interact with autonomous goal-seeking animats. The article discusses the importance of creating interesting and autonomous virtual characters for virtual reality to be engaging. It describes the evolution of Mickey Mouse from a two-dimensional cartoon character to a 3D virtual actor capable of learning and developing his own personality. The article discusses the issue of control when it comes to animated characters and machines that get smarter, arguing that as more lifelike behaviors are implanted into these creations, they become less under the control of their creators. The author suggests that the word "co-control" may be more appropriate to describe this type of relationship between creator and creation. The article also explores the idea of co-control and partnership between humans and machines, using examples from the animation industry. The author argues that the future of control lies in sharing control and destiny with creations, rather than surrendering control to machines.
