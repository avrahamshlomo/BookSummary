The article explores the collective behavior of bees, novices landing a flight simulator, and flocks of birds and fish. The author describes the process of swarming in bees, where the queen bee's daughters scout out potential locations and report back to the group through dance, and the swarm then votes on the best location. The article questions the nature of the hive and who or what governs it, citing William Morton Wheeler's claim that an insect colony is an organism. The article also discusses the power of a group mind, citing Loren Carpenter's demonstration of a live game of Pong controlled by the average movements of thousands of attendees and an experiment in which 5,000 novices were collectively tasked with landing a flight simulator. The article compares the collective behavior of the group to that of a flock of birds and fish, and computer scientist Craig Reynolds' algorithms are discussed, which are so realistic that biologists have concluded that real-life flocks and schools must follow similar simple rules. Finally, biologist Wheeler's concept of emergence is introduced, which refers to a different variety of causation where a qualitative change of direction occurs in the course of events. The text explores the concept of emergence, where complex systems and patterns arise from the interaction of simple elements. The brain is compartmentalized, with different regions handling different tasks, and memory is an emergent event assembled from scattered fragments stored in the brain. The text also discusses the potential of distributed computing and parallel computing to create a more robust and adaptable system. Emergence is a phenomenon where new properties or behaviors arise from a group of interacting entities, and emergent entities are not contained in the properties of individual entities but rather arise from collective behavior. The article discusses the nature of swarm systems, which are collections of autonomous members that react individually according to internal rules and their local environment, forming a peer network without a central hub. The benefits and drawbacks of swarm systems, including adaptability, evolvability, resilience, boundlessness, and novelty, as well as non-optimality and non-controllability, are summarized. The article argues that while swarm logic has its pros and cons, it is necessary to adapt to the crisscrossing, unpredictable, and fuzzy attributes of living systems. The shift from the metaphor of the Atom to that of the Net is discussed, and the implications of this shift for understanding complex systems are explored. The article concludes that the Net represents the messy power of complexity and is a banner of non-control, capable of infinite rearrangements and growth in any direction. The logic of networks is different from human expectations and will shape the culture of humans in a networked world. Alan Kay, a computer pioneer, believes that pervasively networked computers will shape humans in the future. As humans become more connected in a network, unexpected and uncontrollable things will emerge.
