The article discusses the concept of god games, computer games that allow players to act as a deity and control the lives of virtual citizens. Populous II is a god game where players manipulate the land and create flat farmland for people to gain power and worship. The article explores the addictive nature of god games and how they illustrate the subtle shift in our interactions with computers and machines. As technology advances, these games will become increasingly realistic and immersive, and players will pay exorbitant amounts to participate. The article also discusses the potential for these games to evolve into complex and valuable vivisystems. The author uses SimEarth and SimCity as examples of god games that demonstrate the self-correcting cohesion seen in the Earth's global geochemistry and the dynamics of real cities through the use of a collective of richly linked, autonomous, localized agents working in parallel. The article explores the concept of creating worlds through simulation and theory, using examples such as SimCity, flight simulators, and virtual reality. The author discusses how every creative act is essentially the reenactment of the Creation, and how simulations can capture the integrity of the larger whole. The concept of hyperreality, or simulacra, where artificial reality is treated as real, has been explored by Umberto Eco and Jean Baudrillard. This concept has been around since ancient times, but technology has allowed for more sophisticated simulations. Simulacra are being used to personalize the presentation of information, and Lippman has developed a method of delivering video in an ultra-compact form by transmitting a virtual model of the scene. The military is also interested in simulacra for training purposes, and the US military has been using simulation technology for decades to create a more realistic and immersive experience for soldiers. The SIMNET system allows for the creation of a three-dimensional model of a battlefield, providing a panoramic view of the action and allowing for alternative outcomes to be experienced and learned from. The article discusses the use of simulation technology in the military, particularly in the development and testing of weapons and training of soldiers. The military is aiming for "embedded training" where the simulation is so real it is indistinguishable from actual combat. The article also emphasizes the importance of teamwork in the military and how distributed intelligence, rather than just firepower, is what wins wars. The concept of distributed intelligence and how it is being used in the military and industrial sectors is explored. The article also discusses the origins of multiuser fantasy games and their similarities to text-based adventure video games. MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) are text-based adventure games that allow up to 100 human players to explore and modify a virtual world simultaneously. The article discusses Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs), virtual worlds where players can create characters and interact with others. MUDs allow players to explore and modify their virtual identities, earning status and power within the world. Violence is common in MUDs, but Cyberion City, a world created by kids at MIT, outlaws killing and has gained a large following. The article also explores the potential of MUDs as a business environment and the idea of a "god game" where a vast world is set into motion with a few rules and populated by autonomous creatures. The article discusses the concept of creating models of humans, or simulacra, and the potential implications of doing so. The process of creating these models is difficult and requires embracing uncertainty and relinquishing control.
