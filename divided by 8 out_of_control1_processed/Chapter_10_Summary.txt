The article explores the concept of industrial ecology and adaptive technologies that can create an ecology of buildings that can evolve and adapt like living organisms. The author draws inspiration from the work of Antonio Gaudi and imagines a future where homes and buildings can communicate and adapt to their surroundings, creating a human-made forest of organic structures. The article discusses the concept of a "smart house" and the Smart House Partnership formed in 1984 to develop protocols and hardware for intelligent houses. The article predicts that smart offices will materialize before smart homes. The author also discusses the concept of ubiquitous computing, where technology is seamlessly integrated into the environment and objects around us. The book explores the idea of coevolutionary ecology, where machines are like organisms that react to stimuli and communicate with each other. However, current technology is limited by its lack of cooperation and integration, with devices assuming they are the only appliance in the house. The article discusses the concept of an ecology of machines, where machines can work together to enhance their limited skills. The article discusses the concept of computational ecology, where machines and appliances adapt locally, inducing regionalism and localism. The future of computational ecology will involve machines that are more aware of other machines and their environment, where wear encodes useful information and communicates environmental awareness. The article also explores the idea of tracking usage and interaction with documents and how this information can be used to improve them. The metaphor of wear is used to describe the value of shared information and the interconnectedness of machines in an industrial ecosystem. The article argues that human-made industry and the natural sphere can coexist and both prevail, with the concept of industrial ecology based on the idea of mimicking the natural environment where waste is not generated, and everything is recycled. Closed-loop manufacturing is discussed, where products are designed to be easily disassembled into homogeneous parts that can be reused or recycled. The ultimate goal is for all machines, factories, and human institutions to be members of a greater global bionic system that imitates biological manners. The article discusses the shift towards biological-scale processes in industrial development, driven by the need for environmental sustainability and efficiency. It highlights examples of industries that have successfully implemented this approach and suggests that technologies of adaptation can help industries become more organic and sustainable. The article argues that the future of industry lies in a "hydrogen economy" and explores the concept of bionic engineering, which creates a spectrum of ecosystem types ranging from natural to industrial. The article concludes by acknowledging the increasing prevalence of human-made gadgets and the need for sustainable solutions in industrial development. The emerging postindustrial era is a marriage of the born and the made, where neo-biological rather than bionic ideas will dominate.
