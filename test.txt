Wheeler, the ant pioneer, started calling the bustling cooperation of an
insect colony a "superorganism" to clearly distinguish it from the
metaphorical use of "organism." He was influenced by a philosophical strain
at the turn of the century that saw holistic patterns overlaying the individual
behavior of smaller parts. The enterprise of science was on its first steps of a
headlong rush into the minute details of physics, biology, and all natural
sciences. This pell-mell to reduce wholes to their constituents, seen as the
most pragmatic path to understanding the wholes, would continue for the
rest of the century and is still the dominant mode of scientific inquiry.
Wheeler and colleagues were an essential part of this reductionist
perspective, as the 50 Wheeler monographs on specific esoteric ant
behaviors testify. But at the same time, Wheeler saw "emergent properties"
within the superorganism superseding the resident properties of the
collective ants. Wheeler said the superorganism of the hive "emerges" from
the mass of ordinary insect organisms. And he meant emergence as science-
a technical, rational explanation-not mysticism or alchemy.
