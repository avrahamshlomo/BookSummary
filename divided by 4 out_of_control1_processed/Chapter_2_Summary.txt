The author describes the awe-inspiring sight of a beehive and the collective hive mind, which was once a mystery. The Greeks and Romans were famous beekeepers, but they got almost every fact about bees wrong. It was not until the Renaissance that the female gender of the queen bee was proved, and the hive was shown to be a radical matriarchy and sisterhood. The author describes the spectacle of a hive about to swarm, which becomes visibly agitated and spits out masses of bees. The German theosophist Rudolf Steiner writes that "one can truly see in the flying swarm an image of the departing human soul." Finally, the author mentions a beekeeper who had the urge to build a Live-In Hive, an active bee home that one could visit by inserting their head into it. The article describes the process of swarming in bees, where they leave their hive in search of a new home. The queen bee does not lead the swarm, but rather her daughters scout out potential locations and report back to the group through dance. The more enthusiastic the dance, the better the site. The bees then vote on the best location, and the swarm moves there. This process is compared to democracy, where the majority rules. The article also raises questions about the nature of the hive and who or what governs it. Finally, it cites the work of William Morton Wheeler, who claimed that an insect colony is an organism in every sense of the word. In 1991, Loren Carpenter demonstrated the power of a group mind at a computer graphics conference in Las Vegas. He created a live game of Pong where the paddles were controlled by the average movements of thousands of wand-waving attendees. The group learned quickly and played well together. Carpenter then challenged the audience to form a "5" with their wands, which they did with ease. He then asked for a "4", "3", "2", "1", and "0", and the audience quickly formed each number. The demonstration showed the power of a collective consciousness, which Carpenter described as "neither a thing nor a concept, but a continual flux or process." The article describes an experiment in which 5,000 novices were collectively tasked with landing a flight simulator. The group mind proved to be a liability during the decisive moments of touchdown, but they managed to abort the landing and pull the plane up. The group then turned the plane around and attempted another landing, but again aborted due to oscillations of overcompensation. At some point, the group mind collectively decided to do a 360-degree turn and managed to roll the jet on their first solo flight. The article compares the collective behavior of the group to that of a flock of birds, but notes that while birds are completely oblivious to their collective shape and alignment, the group of novices was self-conscious and responded to an overview of themselves. The article concludes by describing a flock of ducks taking off from a lake as a single entity, and questioning how such unity emerges. Computer scientist Craig Reynolds discovered that the flocking behaviour of birds and fish can be modelled using simple algorithms that replicate the movement of a single bird or fish. By copying the movement of one creature and instructing each to follow a set of simple rules, such as not bumping into others and keeping up with neighbours, Reynolds was able to create a realistic flock or school. Reynolds' algorithms are so realistic that biologists have concluded that real-life flocks and schools must follow similar simple rules. Meanwhile, biologist Wheeler coined the term "superorganism" to describe the bustling cooperation of an insect colony, referring to the emergent properties of the collective ants that supersede those of the individual ants. Wheeler saw emergence as a way to reconcile the reductionist approach of science with the holistic view of a whole organism. The concept of emergence in science refers to a different variety of causation where a qualitative change of direction occurs in the course of events. Emergence is the process by which a complex system or pattern arises from the interaction of simple elements. The hive mind of bees and ants is an example of emergence where no one is in control, yet an invisible hand governs. Higher-level complexities cannot be inferred by lower-level existences, and the only sure method to discern emergent structures latent in a system is to run it. The brain is compartmentalized, with different functions taking place in different regions. This was discovered in the late 1800s, when physicians noted correlations between damaged areas of the brain and impairments in mental abilities. The brain is like a bureaucratic organization, with different departments handling different tasks. For example, one department handles letters when spoken, another when read, and numbers are handled by a different department altogether. The brain's specificity is highlighted by the fact that some people can distinguish concrete nouns but not abstract ones, while others can identify abstract things but not concrete nouns. The human memory system is complex and can be affected by various clinical conditions. Some patients can remember inanimate objects but not living things, while others cannot use the past tense. The categorization of memories can be problematic, as evidenced by an ancient Chinese encyclopedia that divided animals into bizarre categories. Computer scientists have studied the architecture of memory in an artificial intelligence context and have debated whether memories are stored in a single location or multiple locations with cross-referencing. Neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield's experiments in the 1930s suggested that memories are stored in specific brain locations and can be replayed like a tape recorder. Memory is not a mechanical process, as shown by Penfield's experiments. Memories are like dreamlike glimpses, rather than exact reruns of past events. Memories are emergent events summed out of many discrete, unmemory-like fragments stored in the brain. There are more possible ideas/experiences than there are ways to combine neurons in the brain, so memory must organize itself in some way to accommodate more possible thoughts than it has room to store. Memories are assembled anew each time they are remembered, using tiny bits of evidence scattered throughout the brain. Our consciousness creates the present and the past from many distributed clues scattered in our mind. The act of perceiving and remembering are the same, both assembling an emergent whole from distributed pieces. Memory is reconstructive, selecting important information and downplaying the unimportant. Sparse distributed memory is a way to fit any perception a mind could have into a finite memory mechanism. Memory is a type of perception, and Kanerva's algorithm can "recall" what a digit was, honing in on the prototypical shape behind all the degraded images. The breakthrough was not just being able to find or replay something from the past but to find something in a vast hive of possibilities when only the vaguest clues are given. The concept of a hive mind is explored in this text, with a focus on distributed computing. The idea of using idle personal computers to create a distributed system is discussed, with the advantages of greater immunity to disruption highlighted. The potential for glitches and failures is also acknowledged, with the example of forgetting vegetables given as a systemwide failure rather than a local memory issue. Parallel computing is presented as a solution to some of these issues, with the advantages of perception, visualization, and simulation noted. The text concludes with a metaphorical description of a sink whirlpool to illustrate the persistence and adaptability of a distributed system. Emergence is the phenomenon of new properties or behaviours arising from a group of interacting entities. Emergent entities, such as a whirlpool or temperature, are not contained in the properties of individual entities, but rather arise from the collective behaviour of many. Emergence requires a multitude of entities, as more is different. Large numbers of entities behave differently than small numbers, and the dynamics of mobs take hold at a high level of connectivity. Systems can be structured as sequential or parallel operations, with real-life systems being mixtures of the two. The most interesting systems are those that operate in parallel, such as the web of life, the economy, societies, and the human mind. These parallel-operating systems are collectively known as networks, complex adaptive systems, swarm systems, vivisystems, or collective systems. The article discusses distributed artificial vivisystems, which are collections of autonomous members that react individually according to internal rules and their local environment. These members are highly connected to each other, forming a peer network without a central hub. The article presents four facets of distributed being that supply vivisystems their character: the absence of imposed centralized control, the autonomous nature of subunits, the high connectivity between the subunits, and the webby nonlinear causality of peers influencing peers. The article also summarizes the benefits and drawbacks of swarm systems, including adaptability, evolvability, resilience, boundlessness, and novelty, as well as non-optimality and non-controllability. The article discusses the nature of swarm systems and the challenges they pose to human control. It argues that swarm systems are non-predictable, non-understandable, and non-immediate, making it difficult for humans to exert control over them. The article suggests that while swarm logic has its pros and cons, it is necessary to adapt to the crisscrossing, unpredictable, and fuzzy attributes of living systems as our inventions shift away from linear, predictable, causal attributes of mechanical motors. The article concludes that for jobs where supreme control is demanded, clockware is the way to go, while for supreme adaptability, out-of-control swarmware is preferred. The article discusses the shift from the metaphor of the Atom to that of the Net, and the implications of this shift for understanding complex systems. The Atom represents individuality, certainty, and simplicity, while the Net represents interdependence, complexity, and multiplicity. The article argues that understanding the mathematical properties of swarm processing is key to understanding both artificial and biological complexity, and that embracing a "hive mind" perspective is necessary to appreciate the swarm nature of complicated things. The article also notes that the Net is related to the Knot, and that unraveling its apparent disorder requires heroism. Finally, the article suggests that the Net is an emblem of multiples and conveys the logic of both computer and nature, which in turn convey a power beyond understanding. The Net represents the messy power of complexity and is a banner of non-control. It nurtures small failures to prevent large failures and is capable of infinite rearrangements and growth in any direction. The network is the least structured organization that can be said to have any structure at all and is nearly synonymous with democracy or the market. A dynamic network incorporates the dimension of time and is more a process than a thing. Network logic is counterintuitive, and adding nodes to a network can decrease the total length of cable. However, there is a limit to this effect, and the best savings a system might enjoy from introducing new points into a network would peak at about 13 percent. Braess's Paradox, discovered by German operations researcher Dietrich Braess in 1968, reveals that adding routes to a congested network can slow it down, which has been observed in various examples, including the addition and closure of roads in Stuttgart and New York City. Scientists studying brain neurons also found that increasing the gain of individual neurons did not improve their signal detection performance, but it did improve the performance of the whole network. These observations demonstrate that networks have their own logic that is different from our expectations, and they will shape the culture of humans living in a networked world. This network culture includes the pervasively networked computers that will shape humans in the future, according to Alan Kay, a visionary who had much to do with inventing personal computers. As we wire ourselves up into a hivish network, many things will emerge that we don't expect, understand, can't control, or don't even perceive.
