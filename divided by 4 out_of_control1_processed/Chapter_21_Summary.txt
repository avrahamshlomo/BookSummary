The theory of heat, which undergirds modern physical science, was a profound puzzle in the early 19th century. The French military engineer Carnot derived a principle in 1824 that became known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which was the key framework in the following century for understanding not only heat but most of physics, chemistry, and quantum mechanics. However, biology has no grand theory, and theoretical biologists are searching for a Second Law of Biology, a law of rising order, which would frame the overarching tendency of life to find order amid disorder. Many postdarwinians doubt that natural selection alone is powerful enough to offset Carnot's Second Law of Thermodynamics. The quest for the secret of life is not usually made explicit in scientists' formal papers, but many of them feel that there is an insatiable force that begins hijacking the slipping heat and order into local areas of higher order. The universe is subject to two opposing forces. The first is Carnot's Second Law, which states that all order will eventually succumb to chaos. The second is the rising flow, which diverts heat before it disperses and borrows failing energy to extract order out of disorder, using it to amplify the next round of complexity, growth, and order. The rising flow is a wave, a sustainable crest always falling upon itself, forever in the state of almost-toppled. It is the eternally moving moment between the two sides of chaos, and biological order rides it down like a surfer. The order accumulated by the rising wave serves as a plank to extend itself, using energy from outside, into the next realm of further order. The story of life is the story of a trickster who has found a foolproof gimmick and is pulling a fast one, getting away with it so far. However, the idea of the rising flow implies a directional charge within the universe, and progress smells of human-centeredness, which some consider to be religious. The abuse of Darwin's theories to bolster racism has also contributed to the demise of the notion of evolutionary progress. The concept of progress in evolution is dead, and the prevalent notion of a "ladder of progress" or a "great chain of being" in biology doesn't hold up under the facts of geological history. All creatures on Earth are equally evolved, having engaged in evolution for an equal amount of time, and no creature is superior to another. The globe graph of life undermines the recurring image of progressive evolution, as there is no pinnacle, just a billion-spotted sphere. While there may not be progress in evolution, there may be a general direction, but many neodarwinians have banned any notions of trends or direction in evolution whatsoever. Steven Jay Gould's book "Wonderful Life" presents the idea that if the history of life on Earth could be rewound and played again, it would not follow the same path as before. The author uses the metaphor of a video tape to explain this concept. If we played the tape in reverse, life would become simpler and less diverse until it ended with a single, tiny organism. Neodarwinists argue that evolution is unpredictable, while postdarwinists believe it is inevitable. However, Gould argues that the idea of evolutionary trends is not supported by the evidence and that the future of life cannot be predicted. The article discusses the idea of whether evolution is inevitable or directed. Gould's metaphor of a water droplet trickling down a broad, low slope is used to explain that although the initial groove is random, the course of the following canyons is fixed. However, when the metaphor is tested in a sandbox, the results suggest that the landscape formations are a limited subset of all possible forms, and the shape of further channel erosion follows a very homogeneous course. The article also mentions the concept of orthogenesis, where life advanced in a direct line from organism A to organism Z, and supernatural forces directed evolution. These notions were outside the realm of science and were not attractive to scientists. The article discusses the idea that machines can have their own purpose and direction, which was first proposed by Norbert Wiener in the 1950s. The author argues that purpose can emerge from purposeless sub-behaviors in machines and that this concept can also be applied to biological evolution. The article suggests that there are seven large trends or directions that have emerged from organic evolution, such as the trend of small organisms preceding larger ones. The author acknowledges that there may be exceptions to these trends, but argues that they provide insight into the inherent teleogism of evolution. The article discusses seven trends of hyperevolution that will bias artificial evolution when it goes marathon, namely irreversibility, increasing complexity, increasing diversity, increasing numbers of individuals, increasing specialization, increasing codependency, and increasing evolvability. It explores the concept of irreversibility in evolution, stating that evolution does not back up, and once a vivisystem discovers a technology, it does not retreat from it. The article also discusses the trend towards increasing complexity, and the various theories proposed to explain it. While it is not clear what drives the trend towards complexity, the article notes that life has not stopped at simple forms and has continued to evolve into more complex organisms. The article discusses three ways in which life has become more complex over time: increasing diversity, increasing numbers of individuals, and endless arms races that escalate complexity. While there is no systematic study of the fossil record to determine whether quantitative complexity increases over time, some studies of short lineages of organisms have shown that sometimes aspects of these creatures increase in complexity and sometimes they don't. The Burgess Shale fossils show a remarkable range of alien organisms thriving during the innovation boom of the Cambrian, which has led to a rethinking of what we mean by diversity. The conventional view of diversity beginning small and ballooning over time is inverted, as the Burgess Shale displays a smorgasbord of structural variety that beats the paltry choice of basic plans which life now offers in the same area. The sheer number of living entities has increased over time, and notions of individuals can be nested within each other in the same limited space. The article discusses four main trends in the evolution of life: increasing complexity, increasing specialization, increasing codependency, and increasing evolvability. Life starts as a process accomplishing many things in general but becomes more specialized over time. As life evolves, it becomes more dependent on other living things and less dependent on the physical environment. Finally, the article explores the concept of increasing evolvability, where evolution evolves itself, inspired by Richard Dawkins' attempts to create artificial evolution. The concept of evolvability suggests that evolution selects not just for survivability, but for the ability to evolve in certain directions or at all. Evolvability is not a single trait, but a systems characteristic that includes mutation rate, behavioral plasticity, and genome flexibility. The evolution of evolution is the process by which change is altered and perpetually generates perpetual change and persistent disequilibrium. Natural selection maintains a mutation rate for maximal evolvability, but the optimal point of evolvability is a moving target. The capacity to evolve must be evolved itself, and evolvability is an essential component of survivability over the long term. Evolution had to precede life if we accept the theory that life evolved from protolife. Natural selection is an abiological consequence that could work on protoliving populations. Evolution has evolved over time, and its complexity and diversity have increased. The history of life is a progression through a variety of evolutions brought about by the expanding complexity of life. The unit subjected to natural selection shifts the tangled hierarchy to a new level of selection. Natural selection selects individuals, and what constitutes an individual evolves. Group selection is still a controversial idea, but the major features of evolution were shaped during periods of transition between units of selection. Artificial evolution will likewise evolve, both artificially and naturally, and it will evolve with a certain bias that it shares with all evolutionary systems. The article discusses the concept of hyperevolution, which refers to the evolution of evolution itself. The author argues that the process of evolution is not driven by a specific goal or entity, but rather towards actualizing itself. Evolution generates complexity and diversity, allowing it to evolve further and become a more powerful evolver. The author suggests that the universe gains possibilities by tolerating this relentless evolution, which suits them as a destination. The self-evolver must be a coyote trickster, constantly remaking itself and becoming more convoluted, flexible, and dependent on itself.
