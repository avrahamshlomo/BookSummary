The article discusses the concept of industrial ecology and the potential for adaptive technologies to create an ecology of buildings that can evolve and adapt like living organisms. The author draws inspiration from the work of Antonio Gaudi, whose buildings in Barcelona exhibit organic, life-like qualities. The article suggests that the ingredients for an ecological house are already present in contemporary homes, with appliances and devices becoming increasingly interconnected. The author imagines a future where homes and buildings can communicate and adapt to their surroundings, creating a human-made forest of organic structures. The article discusses the concept of a "smart house," which is a home that is intelligently wired with universal outlets that provide power and information to all devices. The outlets only dispense power to "qualified" appliances and share information such as identity, status, and need. The networked outlets bundle many wires into one socket, allowing for intelligence, energy, information, and communication to be shared from any point. This concept could be beneficial for the disabled and elderly, as well as for energy efficiency and utility companies. The Smart House Partnership was formed in 1984 to develop protocols and hardware for intelligent houses, and by 1992, the group had built about a dozen demo homes. The article predicts that smart offices will materialize before smart homes due to the intensive informational nature of businesses. Xerox's research labs in Palo Alto are working on a project that views the office as a networked organism composed of many interlinked parts. Mark Weiser, director of the initiative, envisions a future where ubiquitous smart things form a hierarchy, with an army of microorganisms acting as a background sensory net for the room. These frontline soldiers are cheap, disposable small fry attached to writing pads, booklets, and smart Post-it notes. Next, about ten mid-size displays, such as furniture and appliances, interact more frequently and directly with the office holder. The ultimate goal is for the room to know where the person is and adjust the environment accordingly. The article discusses the concept of environmental computing, where every room has a large electronic display that is interconnected with all other objects in the room. This creates an adaptive environment where the technology is almost invisible and ubiquitous, allowing for interaction with objects through their images on the screen. The article argues that the development of computers is a process of collapse, where components become smaller and more distributed, leading to a mechanical environment permeated with human learning. The goal is to put the computer world around us on the outside, creating a constant magic of computation. In a net-ridden room, all smart rooms talk to each other, allowing for easy access to information and resources. The book discusses the concept of ubiquitous computing, where technology is seamlessly integrated into the environment and objects around us. This includes devices that communicate with each other and respond to stimuli, such as a book telling a lamp to turn on when picked up. The author argues that privacy is necessary for this technology to thrive and suggests the development of personal encryption and digital signatures. The book also explores the idea of coevolutionary ecology, where machines are like organisms that react to stimuli and communicate with each other. This could lead to an environment that is animated, responsive, and adaptable, with street signs communicating with navigation systems and billboards sending information to passersby. However, current technology is limited by its lack of cooperation and integration, with devices assuming they are the only appliance in the house. The article discusses the concept of an ecology of machines, where machines can work together to enhance their limited skills. However, this collaborative efficiency comes at a cost as ecologies demand local knowledge, and outsiders may struggle to navigate an unfamiliar environment. Adaptable technology means that technology will adapt locally, inducing regionalism and localism. As a result, every room and building will vary in their electronic ecology, and appliances within a room will also have their own idiosyncrasies. The article concludes by stating that the emerging ecology is daunting to strangers, and using someone else's computer can feel like using their toothbrush. The future of computational ecology will involve machines that are more aware of other machines and their environment. There will be "nice-dog" and "bad-dog" rooms, and people will acquire reputations based on how well-trained and groomed their computers are. However, there will also be neglected areas where the computational infrastructure has been left to become rude, erratic, and unforgiving. To survive, machines must recognize that they inhabit an environment of other machines and share what they know. Wear, an emergent phenomenon, encodes useful information and communicates environmental awareness. Researchers are exploring how to transfer this awareness into the ecology of objects in an office, such as enriching electronic documents with a record of how others interact with them to indicate confusion, controversy, or errors. The article discusses the concept of "churns" in programming code, which are areas of frequent change and can be identified to improve software products. The article also explores the idea of tracking usage and interaction with documents and how this information can be used to improve them. The metaphor of wear is used to describe the value of shared information and the interconnectedness of machines in an industrial ecosystem. The article argues that human-made industry and the natural sphere can coexist and both prevail. The concept of industrial ecology is based on the idea of mimicking the natural environment, where waste is not generated, and everything is recycled. The term was first used in the 1970s to address workplace health and environmental issues. The concept was later expanded to include the environment formed by a web of machines. The goal of industrial ecology is to improve the efficiency of industry and find more acceptable ways of interfacing it with nature. One of the first ideas born out of the organic view of manufacturing was the notion of "design for disassembly." It aims to invent devices that adhere better than glues or one-way fasteners and materials that are easier to recycle. The incentive for these inventions is imposed by requiring the manufacturer to be responsible for disposal, pushing the burden of waste upstream. The article discusses the concept of closed-loop manufacturing, where products are designed to be easily disassembled into homogeneous parts that can be reused or recycled. This approach is cost-effective and profitable, as evidenced by companies like 3M, which has saved $500 million while reducing pollution by 50% per unit of production. Closed-loop systems constantly recycle materials, reducing waste and pollution. The article cites examples of companies that have implemented closed-loop systems, such as a metal refinishing plant in Massachusetts that invented a totally closed-loop system, reducing pollution output to zero and paying for itself in two years. Closed-loop manufacturing mirrors the natural closed-loop production in living plant cells and can be designed into an industrial park or entire region. The ultimate goal is for all machines, factories, and human institutions to be members of a greater global bionic system that imitates biological manners. An ongoing prototype of such a system can be found in an embryonic industrial ecosystem in Denmark. The article discusses the concept of industrial ecology, where industries cooperate to recycle each other's waste products, resulting in a closed-loop system. The article highlights examples of industries that have successfully implemented this approach, such as a power plant supplying waste heat to an oil refinery and using pollutants from coal smoke to create gypsum. However, the article acknowledges that some waste will inevitably be released into the biosphere, and industries must aim to run at the pace and scope of natural systems. The article suggests that technologies of adaptation, such as distributed intelligence and flex-time accounting, can help industries become more organic and sustainable. The article concludes by discussing the pharmaceutical industry's shift towards bioengineered yeast cells to replace toxic chemicals in drug production. The article discusses the shift towards biological-scale processes in industrial development, driven by the need for environmental sustainability and efficiency. The article argues that the future of industry lies in a "hydrogen economy," which would use sunlight to crack water into hydrogen and oxygen, creating an environmentally benign carbonless energy system. The article also explores the concept of bionic engineering, which creates a spectrum of ecosystem types ranging from natural to industrial, with hybrid ecosystems in between. The article suggests that industry will inevitably adopt biological ways due to the efficiency and inspiration it offers, as well as the need to accommodate the natural world and engineer genes and life forms like industrial systems. The article concludes by acknowledging the increasing prevalence of human-made gadgets and the need for sustainable solutions in industrial development. The next century will usher in an era of hyperbiology, where synthetic mice, computer viruses, engineered genes, industrial ecology, supervised evolution, and artificial life will dominate. Silicon research is rapidly moving towards biology, with conferences and workshops focusing on modeling organic flexibility into computer programs, treating nature as a supercomputer, and mimicking DNA's power of evolution. The emerging postindustrial era is a marriage of the born and the made, where neo-biological rather than bionic ideas will dominate. Biology always wins in any blending of organic and machine because it is an inevitability that all complexity will drift towards, an omega point.
