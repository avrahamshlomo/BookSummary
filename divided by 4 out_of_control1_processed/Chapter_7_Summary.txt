The invention of autonomous control has ancient roots in China, with examples such as the south-pointing chariot and the wine straw that regulated wine consumption. However, these devices were not truly automatic in the modern sense, as they still required human intervention to make adjustments. The first truly automatic device was invented by Ktesibios, a barber in Alexandria in the third century B.C., who created a water clock that self-regulated its water supply and kept accurate time. Ktesibios invented the regulating valve, or regula, which was the first self-regulating object. It was a float in the shape of a cone that controlled the flow of water in a water clock, ensuring a constant flow. This invention was the first auto-self, which replaced the human self in its function. The regula was the predecessor to the floating ball in the flush toilet, which is an example of an autonomous mechanical creature. Heron, who worked in Alexandria, created a range of automatic float mechanisms, including the "Inexhaustible Goblet," which refilled itself from a pipe in its bottom. Heron's inventions were widely translated and copied and influenced feedback systems until the 18th century. The only exception was the thermostat, which was invented by Cornelis Drebbel, a Dutch alchemist who created a mini-furnace that could bake mixtures over moderate heat for a long time. He attached a glass tube filled with alcohol that would expand when heated, pushing mercury in a connecting tube, which would close an air draft on the stove. The article discusses three inventions that revolutionized automation: Heron's float, Drebbel's thermostat, and Watt's centrifugal governor. Heron's float used feedback to maintain a constant water level, Drebbel's thermostat maintained a constant temperature, and Watt's governor controlled the speed of a steam engine. Watt's governor was revolutionary as it allowed machines to control their own revolutions and became widely adopted in the industrial age. Watt's invention exemplifies how information can tame the brute energy of machines. The industrial revolution was not just a primitive stage before the information age; it was the first phase of the knowledge revolution, as automatic horsepower was only made useful and desirable through the parallel information revolution launched by the rapid spread of the automatic feedback system. The steam engine was only made possible by the domesticating loop of the revolving governor, which was the first wisp of self-control, sensory awareness, and anticipation. The delay in transposing even the simplest automatic circuit into electronics was due to electricity being seen primarily as power and not as communication. It wasn't until 1929 that an electrical feedback loop was tamed by telephone engineer H. S. Black, who was looking for a way to make durable amplifier relays for long-distance phone lines. Black's invention was needed to dampen the effect of the perpetual recycling of the signal, which tended to compound any tiny deviation from the range it expected until the mushrooming error filled and killed the system. The article discusses the development of automatic feedback loops, which were first conceptualized in the form of electrical circuits. The concept was then applied to the development of computers, which were used to calculate firing settings for large guns during World War I and II. The article also discusses the invention of servomechanisms, which were used to control the rudder of ships and the movement of heavy gun barrels. The development of automatic feedback loops and servomechanisms paved the way for the creation of control systems, which have become an important area of study in the field of biology. The text discusses the false impression one gets from reading about servomechanism loops. Servomechanisms have an uncanny ability to aid steering and are still used in updated technology to pilot boats, control airplane flaps, and remotely operate arms that handle toxic and nuclear waste. The servomechanism of Farcot suggested the possibility of a man-machine symbiosis, where the pilot merges into the servomechanism and together they steer. Norbert Wiener, a former math prodigy, was assigned to the human calculating lab during World War I at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. He published a book in 1948 for nonspecialists on the feasibility and philosophy of machines that learn, which was a best-seller. The term cybernetics was coined by mathematician Norbert Wiener and derives from the Greek word for "steersman." Wiener's book, Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, introduced the concept of feedback control, which revolutionized industry and allowed for precision in manufacturing. The ability of self-control circuits to extract precision from grossness was a completely unexpected miracle. The book's impact was significant, and the idea of feedback control penetrated almost every aspect of technical culture. The cybernetic principle of feedback loops was discovered by engineers who installed electronic feedback devices in steel mills to regulate the thickness of sheet metal. The principle involves manipulating one variable in a system to indirectly control all variables. This plays on the holistic nature of systems, where all variables are tightly coupled. The breakthrough was simple technologically and could have been introduced earlier if approached with an open mind. The Austrian school of economics had already established this view with the "calculation argument," which argued that a single variable, such as price, could regulate all other variables in an economy. This way, the interconnected network itself would calculate resource allotment from the bottom up, out of human control. The article discusses the concept of spontaneous order through the use of automatic control systems. Engineers could relax their efforts to achieve perfect uniformity and instead use self-correcting automation to find the optimal settings for higher quality products. The auto-circuit could be implanted into almost any machine, transforming it into a well-behaved machine. However, in vast networks, the split second it takes to traverse the circuit can cause overcompensation and oscillation, leading to the need for smaller, quicker corrections. Feedback loops can be combined into useful configurations, such as the example of a toilet with a self-regulating loop to turn the knob. The second loop controls the range of the first loop, creating a metacontrol or control of control. The article discusses the concept of circular causality, where a feedback loop can create a tower of subgoals and cause paradoxical effects. This concept challenges traditional logical philosophy and rationality. The article also explores the emergence of self from itself, as suggested by cybernetics, and how it can be seen in the Uroborus, a mythical loop of a snake consuming its own tail. The Uroborus is an emblem for feedback and an archetype of nonlinear being, representing the self in the classical Jungian framework. The self-contained nature of a system, whether it be a thermostat or a valve system, is a tautology that argues for its own identity. All living systems reduce to regulators having conversations with themselves. The advent of automatic control has come in three stages: control of energy, control of materials, and control of information. The third stage, which is the control of information, has flooded our environment with unmanaged data, which is at toxic levels. While the promise of more information has come true, it is useless unless harnessed by a self. The central event of the 21st century will be the subjugation of information, with genetic engineering and electronic libraries leading the way. The impact of this domestication will initially be felt in industry and business before seeping into the realm of individuals. The blossoming of full information control will bring about confusion, brilliance, and impatience. The story of automation is a one-way shift from human control to automatic control, with irreversible transfer from ourselves to the second selves. The key to intelligent control is to give machines freedom, allowing them to adapt, evolve, and grow without human oversight. The challenge of the 21st century is to let go with dignity.
