The article discusses John Perry Barlow, a man who embodies the concept of disembodiment in the information age. Barlow is a ranch owner, Republican Deadhead, and a hippie mystic who moves around frequently, using multiple phone numbers and electronic addresses. He envisions cyberspace as a vast frontier that goes beyond the invisible matrix of databases and networks and includes all information in digital form. According to Barlow, cyberspace is the place where people are when they are talking on the phone. Network economics is causing cyberspace to expand rapidly as it is a resource that increases the more it is used. The author reflects on the early days of personal computers and how they were seen as personal slaves that would reconfigure the world to our specifications. However, the real power of computers was not in their ability to think for us, but in their ability to connect us. By 1992, network technology was the fastest-growing segment of the computer industry, and the introduction of networking logic has overhauled almost every aspect of business. This logic has already shaped products such as instant cash, credit cards, fax machines, and even snack foods, and it will continue to revolutionize the economy and alter laws and financing. The author argues that we should call computers connectors, not computers, as their ability to connect us is their true power. Netted intelligence improves manufacturing by creating adaptive equipment that can produce more varieties of precise materials. Networking also enables remote diagnostics and maintenance of products, with machines becoming nodes of a larger distributed machine. Japanese manufacturing corporations have combined human intelligence and networked computer intelligence to achieve uncompromised quality and mass customization. The challenge is to extend the company's internal network outward to include all those with whom the company interacts in the marketplace. Levi Strauss has networked a large portion of its being, enabling continuous data flows from its headquarters, production plants, and retailers to trigger the order for more materials from suppliers and factories. This results in a tight loop of customer purchase/order materials/make, leading to efficient restocking. The article discusses the concept of flexible manufacturing, which involves using modular and adaptable factory systems to produce products in small batches with quick turnaround times. This requires a networked and decentralized approach, with coordination between various suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. The article explores how companies like Benetton and Kao have used this approach to stay ahead of fashion trends and deliver products quickly. The article also discusses the potential for companies to become purely networked, with no single location and a collaborative, adaptive approach. The trend towards decentralization in business is being driven by the rise of networks, which allow companies to outsource peripheral functions and focus on their core competencies. Even supposedly essential functions, such as engine building for automobile manufacturers, are now commonly subcontracted out. The coordination costs for large-scale outsourcing have been reduced to bearable amounts by electronic trading of massive amounts of technical and accounting information. Networks also make it possible for companies to operate as true distributed companies, with employees and clients in different locations. However, research shows that the transactional costs needed to maintain the quality of a task as it stretches across several companies are higher than if the job stayed within one company. The article discusses the benefits of outsourcing and how it is becoming increasingly common. It argues that outsourcing allows for increased adaptability and reduced costs, especially with the use of network technology. The article imagines a hypothetical company, Upstart Car Inc., which outsources almost all of its operations, including assembly, maintenance, and marketing. It also notes that many successful Silicon Valley companies, such as Apple, have relied heavily on outsourcing. The article concludes by noting that government agencies and municipalities are also beginning to outsource more frequently. The article discusses the rise of collaborative networking and the shift from products to services in the business world. Companies are collaborating with competitors to outsource vital functions and are forming strategic alliances to create symbiotic relationships. The metaphor for corporations is shifting from tightly bounded organisms to loosely bounded ecosystems. The cost of physical reproduction of products is decreasing due to automation, but the cost of research, development, marketing, and customer support is increasing. To make money in the new era, companies must follow the flow of information and invest in networks that engender knowledge. The whole net happens at once, with marketing, design, manufacturing, suppliers, and buyers all involved in the creation of successful products. The network economy involves small items with active microchips that can communicate with the front office and customers. However, there are concerns about this economy, including complexity and bugs in software. Creating complexity without defects is essential, especially as more products depend on complex software. There are two kinds of complex systems: continuous and discontinuous. Most vivisystems are discontinuous, meaning that you cannot rely on interpolated functions. In complex adaptive systems, something novel can suddenly emerge, and this discontinuity is always present. The article discusses the movement towards "zero-defect" software design, which borrows heavily from Shigeo Shingo's work on zero-defect manufacturing. The Japanese view software as a process rather than a product, and in the dawning network culture, more and more of what we make is tangled up in symbol processing which resembles code. Zero-defect quality design proceeds by thousands of distributed "inchstones," instead of a few milestones. Each inchstone is a small module of code that works for sure, and from which more complex layers are added and tested. The task of zero-defect design is to detect errors early and rectify them early. The classic Japanese invention for error prevention is a "poka-yoke" system - making things foolproof. The article discusses the concept of poka-yoke in software development, which refers to the use of techniques to prevent errors before they occur. One such technique is the use of automatic program correction tools that detect and eliminate errors in real-time. Modularization of software is another technique that can reduce the number of faults. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a decentralized and modular approach to software design that uses "objects" as building blocks. Objects in OOP are like Lego blocks that carry a bit of intelligence with them and can communicate laterally with each other. OOP creates a distributed intelligence in software that is resilient to errors, heals faster, and grows incrementally. The article concludes by highlighting that errors tend to cluster in software, making it important to use poka-yoke techniques to achieve high-quality software. The concept of zero-defect software, as outlined in the book of the same name, suggests that error clustering is prevalent in software and that it is better to discard error-prone code than to try and fix it. As software becomes more complex, it becomes impossible to test exhaustively, and the neo-biological approach of assembling software from working parts while continuously testing and correcting it is becoming more popular. However, this approach sacrifices elegance for reliability, and the price of zero-defect software is that it is over-engineered and overbuilt. Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon suggests that while zero-defect products are possible, the question is whether they can be made profitably. The future of network economics lies in devising reliable processes rather than products, but in a distributed, semi-living world, goals can only be satisficed for a moment. The emerging network economy is characterized by distributed cores, adaptive technologies, flex manufacturing, mass customization, industrial ecology, global accounting, coevolved customers, knowledge-based systems, free bandwidth, increasing returns, and digital money. Companies become societies of work centers distributed in ownership and geography, and products are individually customized but produced on a mass scale. Industrial ecology and biologically compatible techniques are prioritized, and global accounting is essential. Customers are trained and educated by the company, and then the company is trained and educated by the customer. Knowledge coordination becomes priceless, and digital money replaces batch-mode paper money. The emergence of network economics will see the interconnection of all things and events into a vast complex web, creating a neo-biological civilization and a global mind. The global mind will be a large complexity governed by an invisible hand, with no central "I" to appeal to. This will lead to a new spiritualism and a never-ending quest to find the "I am" of the global mind. The network economy will also lead to increased decentralization and symbiotic relationships between providers and customers, with the central act being to connect everything to everything. The informal economy will boom, with creative edges and fringe areas expanding and becoming invisibly connected on encrypted networks.
