Lynn Margulis, a biologist known for her theories on symbiosis and the Gaia hypothesis, has challenged the Darwinian theory of evolution, stating that it is incomplete and wrong. Margulis is not alone in her views, as a number of scientists are questioning the limitations of natural selection and seeking alternative theories of evolution. These scientists, known as postdarwinians, do not reject Darwin's contribution but want to move beyond it. The limits of natural selection are important in the pursuit of artificial evolution, and alternative theories that were eclipsed by Darwinism are being reconsidered for examination. Despite Darwin's influence, many naturalists, geologists, and biologists of his time were hesitant to accept his theory in full when it was published in 1859. The article discusses the skepticism surrounding Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, particularly the idea that tiny random improvements were all there was to it. Critics felt that Darwin's explanation did not accurately fit the facts of nature, but they could offer neither compelling disproof nor an alternative theory. Darwin himself acknowledged the weaknesses in his theory, such as the complexity of the human eye. However, he argued that accumulated microchange over millions of years could explain major changes in species. The article also notes that while neodarwinism attempts to explain everything in life through adaptive selection, other forces may be at work in evolution. Until evolution is duplicated under controlled conditions, neodarwinism remains a "just-so" story and not a scientific theory. The search for a complete understanding of spontaneous complexity and the rules by which entities may emerge from a web of parts is part of the quest for more complete explanations of evolution. The advent of ubiquitous computers has birthed a third way of doing science: by simulation. Artificial evolution is at once a theory and test for natural evolution, and something original in itself. Naturalists are conducting long-term observations of evolving populations of organisms in the wild, and shorter-term studies using bacteria and flour beetles show short-term evolution of organisms in the lab, matching the results expected from neodarwinian theory. However, despite a close watch, we have witnessed no new species emerge in the wild in recorded history, no new animal species emerge in domestic breeding, and no cascading emergence of entirely new kinds of variety beyond an initial burst in computer life. The limits of variation appear to be narrowly bounded, and often bounded within species. The standard explanation is that we are measuring a geological event in real time on a ridiculously infinitesimally small time span, so what do we expect? The fossil record has not proven that natural selection is solely responsible for the accumulation of modifications in descendants. The exact transitional moments when natural selection leads to the next level of complexity are not witnessed in the fossil record or in artificial life. Computational life based on natural selection has not seen the miracle of open-ended evolution. While natural selection may be responsible for microchange, no one can say indisputably that it is responsible for macrochange. Natural selection primarily means the destruction of the unfit, but creating something useful is the bugaboo. The origin of fitness is credited to random variation, but this simple process cannot explain the generation of self-organizing complexity over the long term. The article explores the limitations of Darwinian theory and suggests the existence of other mechanisms of evolution, such as symbiosis. Symbiosis, the merging of two organisms into one, is found to be fundamental in microbial life and can lead to the creation of complex systems unlikely to develop incrementally. The article also suggests that genetic information can be shared through intercell gene transfer, leading to a view of all bacteria as a single genetically interacting superorganism. The symbiotic nature of cells challenges classical Darwinian dogma by providing examples of significant evolutionary change that lessens immediate benefits to the individual and is not amassed by slight incremental differences. Overall, the article proposes that routine symbiosis on a large scale could drive many of the complexities in nature. The article discusses the role of symbiosis in evolution, highlighting its advantages in promoting cooperation and diversity. It argues that symbiotic alliances can lead to significant evolutionary jumps, replacing eons of minor alterations. The article also critiques traditional selection theory, arguing that death is not the author of innovation, but merely the editor. The article suggests that genetics has paid more attention to the origin of innovation and variation, with early geneticists struggling to explain how variations arise and are passed on. The mechanism for heredity, discovered to be a code of four symbols, is attributed to cosmic rays or thermodynamic noise, and all variations in an organism are treated as statistical degrees of mutational error. The idea that genetic variation is solely due to random mutation is outdated, as there is evidence of order and selection in the process. Internal selection is a plausible theory where cosmic rays produce errors in DNA, which are then corrected by a self-repair apparatus in a selective manner. This means that some randomness is "more equal" than others, and certain areas of the genome are resistant to change due to gene interdependence. The prevailing logic is that mutations are not truly random, and while individual mutations may range from near-random to plausible, statistically, over the long haul, a mass of mutations behaves randomly. However, a stronger heretical idea suggests that variations can be chosen deliberately by the gene bureaucracy. The theory of directed mutation challenges the traditional view of natural selection, which states that only the environment can select mutations, but cannot induce or direct them. Research on the bacterium E. coli by geneticists John Cairns and Barry Hall suggests that under certain conditions, the bacteria can direct their own mutations in response to environmental stresses, resulting in the production of needed mutations at a rate much higher than statistically expected. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is not yet understood, and many molecular geneticists remain skeptical. Unlike synthetic evolution in computers, biological evolution is complicated by the fact that mutations must be manifested through a chain of intermediate bodies before the terminal effect can be observed. Evolution is both inventive and conservative, making do with what is available and rarely starting over. Developmental time is a crucial factor in the evolution of organisms, and early developmental changes have the advantage of affecting a suite of things in a single blow. However, the more complex an organism becomes, the less likely a very early change will survive. Monsters, or natural mutants, follow internal laws and can even be categorized. The taxonomy of mutants was devised by Etienne and Isidore Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, which became the foundation of the modern science of monsters-teratology. The internal structure of organisms, particularly the genome, and the accumulated morphogenesis of development may have a greater influence on the variety of biological organizations possible than natural selection. Teratologies, or monsters, are a document of the potentiality of a given developmental process, and exhibit generalized transformational rules. The egg cell plays a significant role in the implementation of genes during sex and directs the chromosomal genes as they differentiate, guiding and orchestrating the construction of the baby. Hereditary information does not exist independently of its embodiment, and the origin of an organism's inheritable body, or morphogenesis, is due to a partnership of nongenetic cell material and hereditary genes. The egg cell may be constantly swapping bits of code within itself, between the files of its in-house DNA and the files of inherited chromosomal DNA. The Central Dogma of biology states that information can only flow from genes to the cellular body, not vice versa, but recent discoveries in morphogenesis suggest that there is indirect feedback from the cell to the genes. This feedback occurs during the early stages of embryonic growth and can result in small changes being magnified as development unfolds, leading to the creation of hopeful monsters. These hopeful monsters are fully formed organisms that arrive in niches that a series of partially formed transitional species would never reach, and they are most easily generated by small shifts in developmental timing. The lack of intermediates in the fossil record is a significant issue, and while the appearance of hopeful monsters could explain the absence of transitional forms, it is still a topic of debate in evolutionary theory. Darwin's theory of gradual evolution has been challenged by the "fossil gaps" that remain in the fossil record. Even leading authorities on evolution acknowledge that the fossil record contains few intermediate forms and that most species exhibit stasis and sudden appearance. Darwin's most revolutionary premise was that the discontinuity between species was an illusion, and that every individual differed significantly, but recent studies of complex systems suggest that life is largely clumped into parcels and only mildly plastic. Complex systems cannot easily be gradually modified in a sequence of functional intermediates, and evolution works in quantum steps. The hierarchical nature of the whole prevents it from reaching all possible states, but also gives it the power to make some large-scale shifts. The development of an organism is constrained by physical and genetic limitations, which limit the range of possible forms that can be produced. The interlinked nature of genes creates a conservative force that resists change and restricts allowable variations. Even when subjected to competitive pressures, the genome must materially rearrange its patterns of linkage to create a substantially different outward form. Before an organism can deal with natural selection, it must first be subjected to internal selection by the genome, bodily form, and population at large. Single-point mutations are rare, and genes usually work in complexes, resulting in multiple side effects. The genome seeks to persist as a cohesive unity, and the development of complex organisms requires interdependent coadaptations that produce quantum evolution. Populations exhibit cohesive behavior, making it difficult for new structural types to arise in evolution. Constraints that retain the old also assemble the new, and the role of constraints in assembling life is immense. The density of possible life forms in the space of possibilities determines the ease of searching for new forms of life through evolution. If the space is crowded with feasible beings, natural selection can easily search for new forms of life. If not, evolution needs guidance to proceed through empty wastelands. The article explores the limitations of natural selection in understanding the complexity of evolution and suggests that artificial evolution may provide a way to synthesize evolution outside of biology. The author argues that while neodarwinism presents a compelling story of evolution through natural selection, it fails to account for other components of evolution, such as symbiosis, directed mutation, saltationism, and self-organization. The article suggests that artificial evolution can demonstrate spontaneous self-selection as a means of adaptation and generate initial novelty, but to become a powerhouse of creativity like natural evolution, it needs further creative aspects of natural evolution. The author concludes that evolution is not solely a biological process and that exploring artificial evolution can illuminate the true character of historical evolution. Natural selection is an inevitable process that occurs in populations with variation among individuals in a trait that affects fertility, fecundity, or survival ability and is transmitted from parents to offspring. However, natural selection is not equivalent to evolution, and a more complex mathematics of life is needed to explain the origin of life, the trend toward complexity, and the invention of intelligence. Deep evolution is pluralistic and multifaceted, with various evolutions proceeding at different scales, tempos, and styles. Natural selection is ubiquitous, but other types of evolution are rare and specialized in their roles. As artificial evolution is constructed to breed machines and software, this heterogenous character of evolution must be allowed for. The author outlines four dynamics that they believe would be present in a functioning artificial evolution capable of sustainable creativity. These dynamics include symbiosis, directed mutations, saltationism, and self-organization. However, they also note that there will be limitations to what artificial evolution can create, and that these limitations may hold answers to evolution's creative talents. The author suggests that understanding the biases and inabilities of organic evolution can help identify the vacant spaces in the landscape of possible creatures.
