Mark Pauline is a machine builder who creates intricate and often huge machines that exude biological vibes. His machines are often the only ones of their kind on Earth, and he stages performances for them a couple of times a year. Pauline's maimed hand often has trouble threading a bolt to keep his monsters together, so he wants to replace it with a hand from a robot. He lives in a warehouse in San Francisco, and his pad is flanked by a bunch of grungy galvanized iron huts decorated with signs advertising car-body repair. Survival Research Labs (SRL) is a group that stages performances with mechanical animals and autonomous iron gladiators that demolish each other with flames and brute force. The machines are made from parts borrowed and stolen from other machines and powered by automobiles. The performances are held without official permits, notification of the fire department, insurance, or advance publicity, and the audience sits too close to the action. The machines are designed to interject predators into civilization, as ecosystems without predators become unstable. The machines are getting more sophisticated, and Pauline, the founder of SRL, is always busy breeding new machines to keep the ecology of the circus evolving. Mark Pauline is an artist and inventor who creates machines and robots for his performance art group, Survival Research Laboratories (SRL). He often upgrades old models with new appendages, cross-fertilizes, or midwifes wholly new beings. His shows are underfunded and some of the ancestors he cannibalized to procreate these monsters were stolen. He scrounges the military for machine tools, submarine parts, fancy motors, rare electronics, $100,000-spare parts, and raw steel. His ultimate aim is to make machines autonomous and he is ahead of many heavily funded university labs in attempting to transfer control from humans to machines. In the conflict between nature-born and machine-made, Pauline is on the side of the made, believing that machines have something to say to us. The article discusses the idea that machines have their own complexity and purpose, and therefore deserve respect and entertainment. The author argues that current robots are often treated as slaves and lack autonomy, but the solution is to create more mobile and self-sufficient robots. The article highlights the work of Mark Pauline, an artist who creates shows for machines, and argues that the ultimate goal is to create robots like Robbie the Robot from science fiction who are self-navigating and autonomous. The article concludes by noting that Pauline's work often outpaces that of top universities. The article discusses the work of Mark Pauline, an artist and engineer who creates machines using discarded lab equipment from universities. He does not use blueprints but instead visualizes the machines in his head and cuts the metal accordingly. Pauline's machines, such as a four-legged giant walking machine and a running machine, are not very smart or nimble, but they are significantly cheaper to make than their counterparts created with millions of dollars in research funding. The article also compares Pauline's machines to the efforts of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University's Field Robotics Center, who spent millions of dollars constructing a robot named Ambler that could walk across a courtyard but struggled to navigate its environment. The article concludes by contrasting the abilities of Ambler and a tiny ant that can navigate the same courtyard without incident despite having no image of the space or a clear idea of where it is. Rodney Brooks, an MIT professor, proposed the idea of building an army of small, cheap, and autonomous robots, or mobots, to explore planets instead of relying on one large, expensive robot like Ambler, which was built to withstand Mars' extreme conditions but is too bulky to make it there. Brooks argued that sending millions of tiny robots to a planet would be more effective and cost-efficient than relying on a single intelligent robot. These mobots can be built from off-the-shelf parts, launched completely assembled in one-shot rockets, and coordinated to perform a task without much communication from Earth. Although most of the mobots are dispensable and will die within several months of landing, they are cheaper to launch into space and faster to build than large robots. NASA engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are creating a microrover, a flashy six-wheeled, solar-powered, and self-guiding robot that will likely be the centerpiece of the Mars Environmental Survey in 1997. The "fast, cheap, and out of control" philosophy challenges the slow, thorough, and in-control approach of most industrial designers and has become a slogan for engineers envisioning robots for planet exploration, collection, mining, harvesting, and remote construction. Rodney Brooks, the director of mobile robots at MIT, developed a new logic for building robots that did not require a central control system. Instead, the identity of the robots was spread over time and space, like a nation spread over history and land. Brooks built a series of robots, including "Allen," "Tom," "Jerry," and "Genghis," each with more primitive logic steps and shorter connections than the last. Genghis, a cockroach-like robot without a brain, had six legs, each with its own ganglion of neural cells controlling its actions. Walking emerged from the collective behavior of the 12 motors, without a smart central controller. This "bottom-up control" allowed for self-reorganization and complex behavior without a central brain. In his paper, Rod Brooks outlines how to create a walking machine without a central controller. Each leg is given a few simple behaviors and knows what to do independently. The legs work together to create a new gait, and improvements are added on top of the foundational walking routine. Brooks's mobots learn to move through a complicated world by building up a hierarchy of behaviors, such as avoiding contact with objects and formulating travel plans. The Collection Machine, built by Brooks's grad students, collected soda cans by wandering aimlessly through rooms and avoiding obstacles. The arm of the robot "learned" where it was from the environment and reached out to pick up the can. The article discusses the concept of subsumption architecture, which involves building complex systems by starting with simple behaviors and adding new layers of activity over them. The example of a recycling robot is used to explain how this works, with the robot starting with the simple behavior of collecting cans and gradually adding new behaviors over it. The article also applies this concept to government structures and the human brain and body, arguing that they are also built from the bottom up using simple behaviors that are gradually subsumed by more complex layers of activity. The article provides a generic recipe for creating complex systems using this approach, which involves doing simple things first, learning to do them flawlessly, adding new layers of activity, not changing the simple things, making the new layer work flawlessly, and repeating the process indefinitely. The text argues against the idea of a centralized brain as a way to manage complexity. It claims that central-command models are unstable and inflexible, and that institutions, corporations, factories, organisms, economies, and robots will all fail if designed around a central command. The text also challenges the idea of a centralized brain in humans, arguing that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon arising from the distributed network of many feeble, unconscious circuits. The author suggests that intelligence without reason, constructed layer by layer from the bottom up, is a better approach to managing complexity. The idea that speech is a stream of consciousness is a flawed view, instead meaning emerges from the interaction of many little things. The mind is a theatre of simultaneous possibilities, and consciousness consists of comparing and selecting these possibilities. The society of mind is the idea that intelligence is created by many parts that are mindless by themselves. These parts are always competing and cooperating for resources and recognition. The slightly chaotic character of the mind is a statistical phenomenon, and arriving at a particular thought entails a bit of luck. Multiple Personalities Syndrome depends on the decentralized, distributed nature of human minds, and at different times in our lives, we shift our character. The concept of the "I" or "Me" as an identity for individuals is a gross extrapolation, as there is no "I" for any living thing. Instead, individuals invent their own "I" as a shroud or ghost that can be scattered and reappear. This is an example of a distributed system, where complexity is chunked into modular units arranged in a hierarchy. Hierarchies are paramount and essential in this scheme, as information and authority travel from the bottom up and from side to side. While authoritarian "top-down" hierarchies will retreat, no distributed system can survive long without nested hierarchies of lateral "bottom-up" control. The chunking of control must be done incrementally from the bottom, as attempts to rationally unravel complex problems from the top down inevitably fail. The article discusses the benefits of bottom-up, distributed control in robotics, using the example of a juggling seeing-eye robot arm. Rather than having a central brain control the arm's movements, the tasks were decentralized among a committee of "dumb" agents. Each agent was responsible for a specific task, such as determining if the balloon was within reach, and communicated with the other agents by observing the effects of their actions on the external world. The article argues that keeping communication local and direct allows for the evolution of new behavior while avoiding the complexity that comes with hardwired communication processes. Additionally, maintaining a central memory is difficult, as conflicting information from multiple sensors must be reconciled. Therefore, it is easier to use the real world as its own model, rather than imposing a central world view. The article discusses the subsumption architecture developed by roboticist Rodney Brooks, which involves decentralized control and communication through the world rather than central planning. This model is compared to a market economy, where agents communicate through observing the effects of actions on the common world. The article also highlights the benefits of miniaturization in robotics, which allows for a higher ratio of brains to body weight and the development of small, inexpensive robots that can be used in various applications. Brooks calls for the infiltration of robots in the world to bring artificial life into real life, with examples such as smart doors. The article concludes by summarizing the five lessons from building mobots, including incremental construction, tight coupling of sensors to actuators, modular independent layers, decentralized control, and sparse communication. The article discusses the idea of creating a colony of sentient entities by putting chip brains in various objects. These smart objects would communicate with each other to help control the climate and traffic flow. The vision of robots is less about them serving us and more about creating an ecology of unnamed things just out of sight. The article also discusses the idea of building artificial beings that can do useful work while surviving for weeks or months without human assistance in real environments. The lesson from the Mobot Lab is that there is no mind without body in a real unforgiving world. The article ends by discussing how humans think of themselves as beings focused onto a spot just south of their forehead behind their eyeballs, while the fantasy of a pure disembodied intelligence is just that, a fantasy. The idea of mind transfer, popularized in science fiction, is not grounded in reality as bodies and minds are not distinct entities but rather intertwined and decentralized. The center of behavior is not in the head but rather in the heart, where emotions are regulated by hormones and peptides. Building robots that must survive in real bodies is the only way to develop artificial intelligence, according to Brooks. Additionally, tedium can unhinge the mind, as seen in a study by Canadian psychologist D. O. Hebbs who found that extreme boredom caused volunteers to experience delusions and a detachment of their minds from their bodies. The article discusses the effects of sensory deprivation on the mind and body. Researchers in the 1950s conducted experiments where subjects were placed in dark, soundproof rooms for extended periods. The subjects reported experiencing visual sensations and changes in their perception of reality, but also struggled with concentration and became preoccupied with their own thoughts. The article argues that the body is essential to anchor the mind and prevent it from becoming lost in its own internal circuitry. Without sensory input, the mind can become mentally blind and engage in mental masturbation. The article concludes by discussing the importance of the senses, particularly the eyes, in providing critical information to the mind and how the removal of sensory input can lead to a darker type of blindness. The article discusses the importance of embodiment in understanding the mind and the limitations of machines in this regard. It describes the phenomenon of "black patch psychosis" that occurs in patients who have undergone cataract surgery and are confined to a dark, still environment. The article also highlights the importance of physical embodiment in creating personas for machines, as exemplified by the work of Mark Pauline and Rod Brooks. However, it notes that current robots have limited lifetimes and are improved while off. The article concludes by cautioning that the evolution of machines, like that of life, will proceed in steps and will require patience. In his book "The Age of Spiritual Machines," Ray Kurzweil discusses the evolution of machines and the potential for them to become autonomous and intelligent beings. He highlights the importance of insect-level intelligence in the evolution of complex organisms and argues that artificial insects could lead to the development of artificial apes. Kurzweil envisions a future where machines learn and evolve through vast populations and even suggests the possibility of a human/machine networked mind. He also acknowledges the potential social consequences of this evolution, including the acceptance of humans as the random ancestors of machines. The author believes that humans are a combination of ape and machine, and that there is a unity between simple life, machines, complex systems, and humans. The negative connotation of machines may change as they are remade into something that can be seen as a compliment. The author suggests that humans may find spiritual wholesomeness in knowing that they are a link in a complex machine layered on top of the green life. The destruction caused by machines is seen as necessary for keeping wildlife on course, and the author believes that machines will eventually talk back to humans, inspiring feelings of holy awe.
