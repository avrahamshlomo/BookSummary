Populous II is a god game where players take on the role of a son of Zeus, using a hand of god to manipulate the land and create flat farmland for people. The more prosperous the people become, the more they worship the player, and the more manna (power) the player accumulates. However, other sons of Zeus are also competing for immortality, and they can send disasters to wipe out the player's base of support and worship. The game involves destruction and the accumulation of power through various means, including creating Pan figures, erecting monuments, and sending natural disasters. The game's developer admits that destruction is the primary focus, with few positive actions for the player to take. The game requires players to think like a god to win. The article discusses the concept of god games, which are computer games that allow players to act as a deity and control the lives of virtual citizens. The article mentions several examples of god games, including Power Monger and Civilization, and notes that these games require players to manage their virtual societies in a way that encourages growth and progress. The article also discusses how god games illustrate the subtle shift in our interactions with computers and machines, as we begin to relate to them as if they behave organically. The article suggests that this shift is due in part to the fact that games have historically come first in the development of computers, and that children who grow up playing god games may come to expect machines to behave in a similar way in other contexts. The article discusses the addictive nature of god games, which allow players to create and control their own simulated worlds. The author argues that as technology advances, these games will become increasingly realistic and immersive, and players will pay exorbitant amounts to participate. The article also explores the idea that simulated worlds behave similarly to living organisms, and the potential for these games to evolve into complex and valuable vivisystems. The author uses SimEarth and SimCity as examples of god games, with SimEarth demonstrating the self-correcting cohesion seen in the Earth's global geochemistry and SimCity demonstrating the dynamics of real cities through the use of a collective of richly linked, autonomous, localized agents working in parallel. SimCity is a god game that requires players to balance various factors, such as pollution and taxes, to build a sustainable city. Will Wright, the game's creator, sees it as a "Software Toy" that allows players to explore and learn. SimCity's origins trace back to Wright's earlier game, Raid on Bungling Bay, which he modified to include building utilities. Wright's fascination with bringing a city to life led to the creation of SimCity, where players build a city from the ground up, starting with the geographical foundation and ending with the mayor. Wright studied a simulation of an average city done in the 1960s at MIT to understand city dynamics. The article explores the concept of creating worlds through simulation and theory, using examples such as SimCity, flight simulators, and virtual reality. The author discusses how every creative act is essentially the reenactment of the Creation, and how simulations can capture the integrity of the larger whole. The article also focuses on Jaron Lanier, who pioneered a low-rent system for generating visitable worlds and coined the term "virtual reality." The visitor to a virtual reality suits up in a wired uniform and face mask to experience the illusion of inhabiting a 3-D world. The idea of computer-generated reality, or virtual reality, became popular in the years following Jaron Lanier's demonstrations. Simulations are not new, as toy worlds have been around since early human civilization. However, in the computer age, we are creating simulations with larger bandwidths, more interaction, and deeper embodiment. Anything can be a candidate for a simulation when given energy, possible behaviors, and room to grow. We live in a culture that is rapidly animating a million objects into simulations by electrifying them with smartness. Umberto Eco found America trafficking in subtle messages about simulations and degrees of reality through low-brow roadside attractions, such as wax museums, which blurred the distinction between the real and faked. The concept of hyperreality, where absolute unreality is offered as real presence, is explored by Umberto Eco in his travels to wax versions of Leonardo's Last Supper. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard also discusses hyperreality in his book Simulations, stating that the map now precedes the territory, creating a model of a real without origin or reality. In the desert of the real, we are building paradises of the hyperreal, preferring the model (the map) over the territory of the simulacra, which is blank. The word simulacra has a loaded meaning, with origins in the Greek Epicureans' theory of vision, where every object gave off an "idol" or simulacra that impinged upon the eye causing vision. The concept of simulacra, or hyperreality, refers to an artificial reality that is treated as real by individuals. This can include things like TV shows, phone conversations, and computer screens. Simulacra have been around since ancient times, with idols and statues being animated by ghosts or spirits. Today, technology allows for even more sophisticated simulations, such as virtual reality worlds. While some may question the reality of these simulations, they have become an important part of modern life and are being used to personalize the presentation of information. Lippman has developed a method of delivering video in an ultra-compact form that can be unpacked in a thousand different ways. He achieves this by transmitting a simulacra, a virtual model of the scene, rather than a staid image. This method allows for data compression and the ability to break the tyranny of video as prepackaged frames. Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Lab, believes that entire scenes, figures, and all, can be modeled into simulacra for transmission. The purpose of transmitting simulacra is primarily data compression, as real-time holography requires astronomical amounts of bits. The military is also interested in simulacra, as it allows for the modeling of battlefields, which can be used for training purposes. The Pentagon recreated the Battle of 73 Easting, a US victory in the Gulf War, as a three-dimensional simulated reality. Soldiers who had fought in the battle provided information to create the simulation, including diaries, personal tape recordings, and the use of black boxes in each tank. The simulation was created over nine months, with soldiers reviewing and correcting the model. The final version was viewed by military brass, who experienced a realistic sensation of being in the battle. The simulation provided a panoramic view of the battlefield, with the ability to pick any vehicle and see what the driver would see. The simulation allowed for a God's-eye point of view, providing a map-like view of the action. The US military uses simulations to immerse cadets in hyperrealistic war scenarios, allowing them to experience and learn from alternative outcomes. The SIMNET system transports tank and aircraft pilots to a surrogate world where they can do battle without the constraints of safety, cost, environmental impact, or geographical boundaries. Every tree, building, creek, telephone pole, and dip in the land for hundreds of square miles is digitized and represented inside the three-dimensional land of the SIMNET model. The virtual space is huge enough to easily get lost in. The military uses SIMNET to boost realism by devising vehicles steered by artificial intelligence, which are loosely herded by one computer operator. The US military has been using simulation technology for training purposes for decades, with the aim of creating a more realistic and immersive experience for soldiers. Semi-automated forces are being used to create larger and more complex simulations, with the ability to simulate a battalion of 500 people. This technology has been used to great effect in the Gulf War, with 90% of US Air Force units and 80% of ground force leaders having intensive training in battle simulations beforehand. The National Training Center in California uses a $100 million hi-tech laser and radio network to simulate battle with real tanks in a real desert. The military is aiming for "embedded training" where the simulation is so real it is indistinguishable from actual combat. The increasing use of simulation technology in military training has led to the blurring of lines between virtual and real combat. The idea of using simulations to fight real wars has been discussed, with unmanned vehicles and remotely guided planes already being used in combat situations. However, the military's slow progress in adapting to new technology means that simulations are only slightly more advanced than commercial versions. The article also mentions a science fiction novel, Ender's Game, in which young boys are trained to be generals through nonstop tactical and strategic games in a zero-gravity space station, culminating in a massive video war game that turns out to be a real battle. BattleTech is a simulated world game launched in 1990 by Weisman and Babcock, based on one of their game's premises. The $2.5 million center runs seven days a week in a mall on the North Pier in downtown Chicago. BattleTech bears an uncanny resemblance to SIMNET, with a set of twelve cramped boxes bolted to a concrete floor linked in an electronic network. Each box is detailed with futuristic nonsense of the outside and inside stuffed with glorious "switchology" - knobs, meters, flashing lights - a sliding seat, two computer screens, a microphone by which to communicate with teammates, and a few working controls. The rules are war simple: it's kill or be killed. Predominantly unmarried males in their twenties are the fanatical users of the game. The masters of BattleTech claim that it took them about 5 games merely to get used to driving the mech and firing basic weapons, and about 50 games to master cooperating with others. Team-playing is the whole point. The survey queried 47 maniacal players and asked them what BattleTech should change; only two replied that the management should work on "improving reality." Rather the majority wanted lower costs, less crashable software, more of the same. The article discusses the use of simulation technology in the military, particularly in the development and testing of weapons and training of soldiers. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is pushing for a new kind of simulation technology that allows for a distributed military/industrial complex, creating a seamless distributed army and hyperreality. The use of simulation technology allows for better design and testing of weapons, reducing the need for physical prototypes and saving money. The article also emphasizes the importance of teamwork in the military and how distributed intelligence, rather than just firepower, is what wins wars. The article discusses the concept of distributed intelligence and how it is being used in the military and industrial sectors. The Distributed Simulation Internet (DSI) protocol allows for the assembly of independent simulations into a unified virtual space. The article also explores the use of distributed intelligence in multiuser fantasy games, which are electronic adventures that are run on a large network of university and personal computers. Players spend hours logged into fantasy worlds based on popular novels. The article discusses the origins of multiuser fantasy games and their similarities to text-based adventure video games. MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) are text-based adventure games that allow up to 100 human players to explore and modify a virtual world simultaneously. Players can create rooms, modify passages, and invent new objects, making the game a collaborative effort. MUDs allow players to define their identity and explore various facets of their persona through virtual characters. The slipperiness between real life and virtual life is one of MUD's chief attractions, particularly for teenagers. The more players explore and modify the MUD-world, the more status they earn from the rulers overseeing that world. The ultimate goal for every MUDer is to achieve local god or wizard status, but stories of abusive and deranged gods are legendary on the Internet. MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) is a virtual world where players can create characters, interact with others, and engage in activities like flirting, TinySex, and pranks. Sherry Turkle believes that MUDs allow players to decentralize and multiply their selves. Violence is common in MUDs, but Cyberion City, a world created by elementary and high school kids at MIT, outlaws killing and has gathered a huge following. Cyberion City has no map, and players must explore to learn how things work. The continuous telecommunication traffic from MUDing can cripple computer centers, leading some institutions to ban MUDing. Most MUDs are created by students in their spare time, but some commercial online services offer almost-MUDs that limit users' power to alter their worlds. The article discusses the future of MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and their potential as a business environment. It also explores the idea of a god game, where a vast world is set into motion with a few rules and populated by autonomous creatures who coevolve the system into a game different than it began. The article references the story of Yahweh creating man, imbuing him with free will and creativity, and how some of Yahweh's creatures have begun to create their own models of themselves. The simulacra they have built so far vary, some existing on a virtual space plane. The article discusses the concept of creating simulacra, or models, of humans and the potential implications of doing so. Some people see it as a way to replicate Yahweh's creation, while others fear it could lead to the demise of humanity. The process of creating these models is difficult, and they will never be perfect or under complete control. To create something truly novel, the creators must relinquish control and embrace uncertainty. The article concludes that letting go is the only way to win in the "god game" of creating simulacra.
