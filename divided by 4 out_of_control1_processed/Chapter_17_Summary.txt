Life is an open-ended process that continually expands the possibilities of its own being. The first life on Earth lacked the genetic variety to coordinate a swarm of bees, but it discovered how to create new genes and expand its genetic library. Life's charter is open-ended, and it continues to enlarge the space of its own being, adding new wings to the collection and making room for more improbable texts. The transition from fixed gene space to variable gene space is not fully understood, but an open genome leads to open evolution. The article discusses the limitations of predetermined genetic systems in creating open-ended evolution, and introduces Karl Sims' use of a genome composed of small equations to create an open-ended artificial world. Sims' equation-genes were small self-contained logical units of a computer language, which allowed for the creation of any mathematical equation and subsequently any picture. By randomly flipping a logical unit rather than a digital bit, Sims was able to create entirely new kinds of pictures that evolved by his equations. The use of logic units instead of digital bits allowed for an opened-ended universe where new kinds of functions and things could emerge. Computer scientists have been experimenting with the idea of evolving logic programs to solve problems. One such scientist, John Koza, has been breeding the best equation to solve a particular problem, such as finding an equation that could steer a moving robot. This approach is similar to that of Karl Sims, who evolved pictures using logic equations. The surprising success of artificial evolution has shown that conventional wisdom about the brittleness of logic programs was wrong. The text discusses the use of evolutionary programming to solve complex problems by combining and modifying mathematical equations. Koza's method involves randomly recombining parts of two equations that are somewhat effective in solving a problem to create a new, potentially more effective program. The breeding population is made up of logical "trees" that are sexually swapped to force variety. The method has been used to solve a variety of problems, including motor-control calculations, maze navigation, quadratic equations, and game strategies. However, the resulting equations are often messy and inelegant, with redundant and circuitous logic. Despite this, the method can yield solutions that work. The article discusses an experiment by John Koza, in which a computer program evolved an equation to solve a problem. The equation was complex and difficult to understand, leading to the conclusion that evolution generates code that only an alien would write. The experiment also highlighted the lack of evolutionary pressure towards simplicity. Koza believes that parsimony is overrated and that nature does not simplify for elegance. Humans seek simplicity for convenience, but nature and parallel computers are not troubled by convoluted logic. The article ends with the irony that human consciousness struggles to think in parallel, despite the brain running as a parallel machine. The human mind is limited to thinking in a linear, serial narrative, which is why the first computers were designed in a similar way. However, parallel computers are evolving and opening up new territories in our intellectual landscape, forcing new questions and perspectives. Evolution is an answer to teaching computers how to learn to solve problems without being explicitly reprogrammed for every new problem. Evolution allows a computer's software to solve problems to which the scope, kind, or range of the answer(s) may not be evident at all. The nature of life is to delight in all possible loopholes, breaking any rule it comes up with, and the catalog of natural oddities is almost as long as the list of all creatures. In contrast, most machines are cut to fit a specific task, but an ideal machine would adapt and evolve. If we predefine the organizational structure of a machine, we predefine what problems it can solve. The ideal machine for artificial intelligence is a general problem solver with an open-ended structure that can generate machines that do not possess a predefined architecture. The only machine that can reshape its internal connections is the brain, but software programs that can reprogram themselves are being developed. The evolving equations of Sims and Koza are the first step towards a self-reprogramming machine. Equations that breed other equations create perpetual novelty, the creation of never-ending newness. Directed, supervised, optimizing evolution can explore beyond the reach of our own understanding and refine what we have. Natural selection is required for open-ended artificial evolution to find things we don't anticipate. The traits of selection should emerge naturally from the artificial world itself. Artificial natural selection is installed by letting the world determine its own fitness selection. The jump-start of life as a single-celled organism leads to a "Cambrian explosion" of new organisms. The article discusses the use of evolution as a tool for engineering and creating open-ended evolution. The author argues that evolution can be used to reach goals that cannot be reached by other means, to reach places that cannot be imagined, and to open up entirely new places to explore. The article explores the potential for creating autonomous and self-sustained evolution, with the goal of setting in motion a process of self-organization. While this remains a dream for biochemists, the article suggests that the potential for open-ended evolution is vast and holds promise for creating new possibilities in the future. Scientists are working on creating an autonomous, evolving, molecular system that could create all possible biologies, which would be a significant achievement in biology. However, they clarify that they are not trying to create life that could develop its own civilization. Chris Langton, who launched the field of artificial life, believes that artificial life could create its own civilization. Langton's interest in artificial life began when he programmed a game called Life, which generated an infinite variety of forms in patterns reminiscent of biological cells growing, replicating, and propagating on an agar plate. He wondered if it was possible to design a game like Life that would be open-ended so that things would start to evolve on their own. Langton, a computer scientist, was inspired to create life in silicon after experiencing the process of moving a program from one computer to another through abstraction. He also had a personal experience of watching his brain "reboot" after a hang-gliding accident that left him with 35 broken bones. This led him to wonder if life could be independent of its matrix and if life in both his body and computer could be the same. He began experimenting with artificial evolution using an Apple II and discovered the literature of cellular automata and John von Neumann's proofs of artificial self-replication. Langton eventually created the smallest self-replicating machine known at the time and realized that very little science had been written on life's essential processes. Artificial Life is the attempt to abstract the logic of life in different material forms. Life is a process, a behavior that is not bound to a specific material manifestation. The most important thing to remember about A-life is that the part that is artificial is not the life, but the materials. Real things happen. We observe real phenomena. It is real life in an artificial medium. Biology faces the fundamental obstacle that it is impossible to derive general principles from single examples. Since we have only a single collective example of life on Earth, it is pointless to try to distinguish its essential and universal properties from those incidental properties due to life's common descent on the planet. The article discusses the concept of artificial life, which involves creating alternative life-forms to better understand the general principles and theories of life. Artificial life involves synthesizing life rather than analyzing it, and it acknowledges a new definition of life that includes hyperlife - a particular type of vivisystem endowed with integrity, robustness, and cohesiveness. Hyperlife includes both organic and artificial life and shares a set of characteristics that we have only begun to discern. The article suggests that man's every attempt to create life is a probe into the space of possible hyperlifes, which includes all endeavors to re-create the origins of life on Earth. The field of artificial life aims to map the space of all possible life, not just life-as-we-know-it, by building many examples of synthetic life and seeing if they fit in the space. Life is a property of form, not matter, so the more materials that can transplant living behaviors into, the more examples of "life-as-it-could-be" can be accumulated. The ultimate goal is to create a few lines of code that run for centuries, similar to an acorn that turns into a 180-year-old tree. The artificial life experimenters are redefining both artificial and real and espousing the emerging new academic creed of "demo or die." The article mentions SimLife and Polyworld as examples of artificial life programs. The article discusses the concept of artificial life and how it extends the class of life beyond organic carbon-based life forms. Scientists and researchers create ensembles of new forms of hyperlife to explore the possibilities of life-as-it-could-be. However, the article also raises concerns about how life is using humans to create new forms of life, and how humans may be the first species to create their own successors. The potential successors could be either cold and malevolent or glorious and enlightened creatures that far surpass humans in intelligence and wisdom. The article emphasizes the responsibility that comes with creating life and the burden it places on humanity's shoulders. The author envisions a future where we will create an open-ended world that can keep going and creating perpetual novelty, which will be another living vector in the life space. Danny Hillis wants to create a computer that can give open-ended life and freedom, like giving someone their life and car keys and letting them make it up as they go along. Tom Ray wants to upload computers into life rather than downloading life into computers.
