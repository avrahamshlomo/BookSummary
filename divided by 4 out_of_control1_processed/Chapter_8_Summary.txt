The Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco has created a self-contained South Pacific ocean that compresses the life of a mile-long underwater reef into a few yards behind glass. The condensed reef is a synthetic version of the natural coral reef, but it still provides a true living community for the creatures within it. To maintain the synthetic reef, a clanking army of pumps, pipes, and gizmos vibrate on electric energy to support the toy reef's ultradiversity. The whole wired show is a delicate, hard-won balance requiring daily energy and attention. Marine biologist Lloyd Gomez mixed buckets of microorganisms together in large plastic trays, gradually adding species in different sequences in hopes of attaining a stable community, and after five years of constant babying, he now has a full food web in his tank so he no longer has to feed them anything except sunlight. The article discusses the process of building a coral reef and the importance of microbes in creating a stable ecosystem. The author highlights the work of Lloyd Gomez, a reef-building expert, and his experience in creating a toy reef that eventually fused into a living rock. The article also discusses the importance of sequencing the introduction of species into an aquarium and the role of microbes in creating a stable closed ecology. The author emphasizes the need for a delicate balance of dissolved gases, trace chemicals, pH, microorganisms, light, wave action, and temperature to maintain a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Folsome and Hanson conducted experiments with sealed flasks containing simple microbial societies and found that closed ecosystems with even modest species diversity rarely fail. These ecosystems require an initial staging period of fluctuation and instability lasting between 60 and 100 days, after which they find a common balance and become self-sustaining. Folsome's sealed microbial miniworlds recycled carbon, maintained biological productivity rates, produced stable oxygen levels, and maintained populations of organisms indefinitely. Folsome concluded that microbes, not larger organisms, do the lion's share of breathing and generating air, supporting the indefinite populations of other organisms on Earth. These experiments suggest that an invisible substrate of microbial life steers the course of life's whole and welds together the different nutrient loops. The Ecosphere is a self-contained, closed world that contains brine shrimp, algae, and microbes. It is a totem of all closed living systems, inviting us to meditate on ideas like "systems," "closed," and "living." The shrimp and algae have a collective life, and getting them to reproduce in their closed world has been problematic. The Ecosphere is a commercial product that can be purchased by mail order and is like buying a Gaia or an experiment in emergent life. It is a system that is autonomous and interconnected, and surprises can occur, such as an ecosystem staying alive in total darkness for six months or erupting into a breeding panic after two years of steady temperature and light. The Ecosphere is a book jacket blurb about the real thing, and it is a totemic bridge between the separate worlds of spirit and dreams. The Ecosphere, a self-sustaining closed world, lacks the turbulence necessary for the preservation of the world. Without fire, flash, high levels of oxygen, and serious friction, the Ecosphere becomes rigid and dominated by blue-green algae. However, adding a lightning-generating appendage could rejuvenate the Ecosphere. The Ecosphere is a mail-order proof that self-sustained systems want to happen. Ecospheres scale up well, and a huge commercial Ecosphere holds 3,000 shrimp, making the ecosystem more resilient with more individual lives. The law of large numbers takes hold in the Ecosphere. The article discusses the concept of closed ecosystems, specifically the idea of creating a closed system in which a human could survive. The article explores the idea of using algae and plants to generate oxygen and food, while humans produce carbon dioxide and nutrients, creating a symbiotic relationship. The first experiment was conducted by a Russian researcher in 1961, who sealed himself in a steel casket with eight gallons of algae, but the experiment failed due to the build-up of other gases. Further experiments were conducted in Siberia, where dogs and rats were kept alive for up to seven days, and a human survived for 30 days in an airtight room with a tub of algae. However, excess carbon dioxide needed to be removed by chemical filters to maintain the balance of the atmosphere. The article discusses the history and development of closed ecological systems, or biospheres, that can support human life in space or other isolated environments. The Soviet Union constructed the Bios-3 in 1972, which housed up to three men and relied on hydroponic plants for food and air. NASA later developed the CELSS program and the Breadboard Project, which experimented with using plants for food and air in closed systems. Ultra-intensive gardening, using hydroponic systems to produce concentrated plant growth, was found to be a workable solution. Frank Salisbury of Utah State University discovered ways to plant spring wheat at 100 times its normal density, which could provide a significant amount of calories in a closed system. The article discusses the Synergia Ranch commune's vision of creating a living satellite, a sealed glass dome filled with biological systems that would self-organize to create a biospheric atmosphere. Unlike NASA's Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, the Synergians relied on uncontrolled life to sort itself out and come to a self-enhancing harmony. The group, now called Space Biosphere Ventures, designed and built a test unit that was crammed with plants, sensitive environmental monitoring equipment, and a tiny kitchenette and bathroom. In September 1988, John Allen sealed himself in for the unit's first trial run. The article highlights the commune's vision and their faith in uncontrolled life to create a sustainable living environment in space. The Biosphere 2 experiment was successful in creating a sealed environment with a stable atmosphere, thanks to the use of ecotechnics, a hybrid technology that combines machines and living organisms. The experiment showed that humans could live in a sealed environment for an extended period of time, as long as the atmosphere remained stable. However, the atmosphere was sensitive to perturbations, which caused it to vacillate easily. The experimenters envisioned a near-future Mars station built as a mammoth closed-system bottle, and calculated that a sphere with a radius of 58 meters-half air and half microbial soup-could support the oxygen needs for one person indefinitely. The Biosphere 2 project was a grand experiment in creating a self-sustaining ecosystem, built with the help of Ed Bass for $100 million. The completed project was a giant glass ark the size of an airport hangar, with a stainless steel tray 25 feet under the soil to prevent air seepage. The final floor plan had seven biomes, including a rainforest, hot grassland, saltwater lagoon, thornscrub, wetland, desert, and an intensive agriculture and urban area where eight humans grew their own food. The project aimed to test the assumption that diversity ensures stability and whether complexity could birth self-sustainability. The project included a variety of animals, including lizards, fish, and birds. The article describes the challenges faced by the designers of Biosphere 2, a closed ecological system meant to replicate the Earth's ecosystems. The system had to include a variety of species that would create a self-supporting network, producing oxygen, food, and supporting each other's needs. The article highlights the difficulties of choosing the right combination of species to create a balanced ecosystem, and the process of creating soil and an artificial coral reef. The article also mentions the construction of a one-million-gallon ocean, complete with a sandy beach and a wave-making pump. The article describes the process of designing a synthetic biome at the Biosphere 2 research facility in Arizona. The process involved ecologists with expertise in different areas coming together to select and combine species from different biomes to create a functioning ecosystem. The lack of comprehensive data on species and their interactions made the process challenging, and negotiations and diplomacy were required to balance the needs of different organisms. The ecologists aimed to build redundancy into food webs to ensure that the ecosystem could adapt to changes. The article highlights the complexity of ecosystems and the difficulty of predicting the outcomes of ecological interventions. The Biosphere 2 project aimed to create a closed ecological system with a variety of animals and plants to sustain human life. The project faced challenges in providing suitable habitats and food for the animals, especially the land turtles, and in creating artificial rain for the cloud forest. The project required biologists to think like engineers and engineers to think like biologists. The system recycled water, and a certain extinction rate was expected for evolution. The animal occupants included leopard tortoises, blue-tongued skinks, various lizards, small finches, and pygmy green hummingbirds. The designers aimed to have a higher ratio of females to males for reproduction insurance. The article discusses the methods used by scientists to build and maintain a diverse ecosystem in Biosphere 2, a self-sustaining habitat designed to mimic Earth's environment. One method involved cramming more species into the habitat than expected to survive, allowing for species attrition and then reinjecting slightly different species to stabilize the numbers of species at a higher level. Another method involved compressing a natural biome, such as a mangrove swamp, into a smaller space within Biosphere 2 to jumpstart initial variety and further diverse growth. However, the analog method of biome building can only achieve a limited level of diversity. Biosphere 2 ultimately became a synthetic ecosystem, with many analog parts, and is seen as a symbol of the future of heavily synthetic ecologies, similar to what is already happening in California and Australia. The article discusses the concept of synthetic ecology, which refers to ecosystems that have been created or modified by human activity. The author argues that many ecosystems around the world, including rainforests and the Great Lakes, are now synthetic due to the introduction of non-native species and other human interventions. The article also describes the creation of Biosphere 2, a closed ecological system designed to study synthetic ecosystems, and the principles of biospherics that were developed during its creation. The article concludes by suggesting that the study of synthetic ecosystems can help us better understand the behavior of natural closed systems, such as the Earth as a whole. The chameleon and shrimp respond to their generated environments, and closed systems like terrestrial evolution and artificial systems breed variety and differences. However, all closed systems eventually open or leak, leading to cross-panspermia and marvels from one system arriving in another. Closed miniature Gaias are constructed to answer questions about human influence over the unified system of life on Earth. The models aim to determine whether Gaia is entirely out of human control or if there are levels of influence that can be reached.
