The article discusses the potential of digital tapes, particularly DAT, to securely encrypt and hide large amounts of information, including libraries of books or blueprints for technologies, within music or photos. This technology can be used for wholly anonymous transactions, making it impossible to trace the exchange of information and money between two strangers. Encryption methods developed by military agencies are becoming more affordable for the average person, leading to the potential for more sophisticated untaxed black markets and a movement towards Crypto Anarchy. The article suggests that encryption will win in a coming war between those who want full disclosure and those who want privacy and civil liberties. The advent of encryption technology and its widespread use poses a threat to the current corporate monopoly on expertise and proprietary knowledge. Encryption will make it easier to sell information on the internet, eroding the ability of corporations to keep secrets. However, the military currently has a monopoly on encryption knowledge, and very little technology has trickled down for civilian use. Encryption has become important in the information age, where intelligence is a chief asset of corporations. Corporate spying and illicit transfer of corporate know-how have become the treasonous information that the state has to worry about. With computers becoming fast and cheap, enciphering no longer demands supercomputers and superbudgets. Encryption has become an essential tool for securing the highly decentralized network of networks that has emerged in recent years. Peer-to-peer encryption has made it possible for even small businesses to use encryption as a business tool. However, the US government has been reluctant to give encryption back to the people, leading to a group of individuals known as cypherpunks to create, assemble, or appropriate encryption technology to plug into the Net. The cypherpunks meet regularly to discuss various topics related to encryption, including digital reputations, PGP encryption, anonymous re-mailer update, and the Diffie-Hellmann key exchange paper. These meetings involve technical discussions that require a strong mathematical background, which is lacking among most members. The article discusses the efforts of a group of amateur crypto-hackers who interact through the Cypherpunk electronic mailing list to implement ideas on the cheap and discuss the ethical and political implications of their work. The group believes that digital anonymity is as important a civil tool as authentic identification and is necessary for a pretty good society. They seek to build tools that provide digital equivalents to interpersonal conventions in face-to-face society, such as anonymity, identification, authentication, reputations, trust holders, signatures, privacy, and access. The Information Liberation Front, an anonymous subset of the group, locates scholarly papers on cryptology in expensive journals, scans them, and posts them anonymously to the internet. The group also discusses the potential market for anonymity, including selling information that isn't viewed as legal, whistleblowing, confessionals, and dating personals. The cypherpunks aim to provide free digital signatures and online anonymity through the development of anonymous re-mailers. These re-mailers work by relaying messages through multiple sources, making it impossible to trace the source of the message. Digital pseudonymity is also seen as a way to decrease costs and increase access to information. Encryption is seen as a way to level the playing field against centralized computer resources, but it can be expensive and unwieldy to use. The cypherpunks aim to use the Fax Effect to increase the value of encryption by making it more widely available. The increasing returns of the Net go against classical economic theories of wealth based on equilibratory tradeoff. The article discusses the idea of network economics, where giving things away for free can lead to more rewards in the long run. This is because in network economics, more brings more. The cypherpunks, hackers, and hi-tech entrepreneurs already understand this concept. The article highlights the use of encryption freeware, such as PGP and RIPEM, and how they are based on RSA's patented implementation of encryption algorithms. PGP is home-brew code created by Philip Zimmermann, making it outlaw-ware. However, it is still exchanged on the internet in the no-place of the Net, where the law on intellectual property is murky. Zimmermann released PGP into the world because he was concerned that the government would reclaim all public-key encryption technology, including RSA's. The article concludes by discussing the Fax Effect, the rule of freeware upgrade, and the power of distributed intelligence as part of an emerging network economics. The article discusses the role of encryption and digital technology in shaping politics and privacy in a network economy. The cypherpunks' obsession with encryption is based on the idea that pretty good privacy means pretty good society. Networks shift privacy from the realm of morals to the marketplace, where privacy becomes a commodity. In a world where everything is connected, disconnection and anti-information become expensive, and encryption systems are technologies of disconnection. Privacy transactions will soon take place in the marketplace, where hundreds of privacy vendors will sell bits of privacy at market rates. The article suggests that privacy is a type of information that has its polarity reversed, and the absence or vaporization of a bit of information becomes very valuable, especially if that absence can be maintained. The article discusses the history of metering and billing for electricity and compares it to the current lack of an information meter in the information industry. Edison initially favored a flat fee for electricity, but struggled to find a reliable way to meter it until a decade later. Similarly, there is currently no reliable way to meter and charge for information usage. However, entrepreneur Peter Sprague believes he has invented a solution using encryption to force metering of information. His device dispenses small bits of information and charges users per page or paragraph, decoupling the ease of copying information from the need to selectively disconnect it. However, the article notes that this will not stop hackers from siphoning off free information, as seen with the compromised Videocipher encryption system. The article discusses the challenges of preventing piracy and hacking in encrypted systems. It explains how pirates used to clone the identity of a descrambler box to make illegal copies of satellite TV, and how encryption has made it more difficult to pirate software and CDs. The article argues that information wants to be copied and that attempts to control replication are often futile. The solution proposed is to disengage payment from duplication through crypto-metering, which allows users to make as many copies as they like while paying only for what they use. The article concludes that success in a networked world belongs to those plans that do not resist the replication or roaming urges of information. Software developer Cox proposes a new revenue model for the software industry that is based on a "per use" plan rather than copy protection. He suggests that software objects can monitor their use, and vendors could dispense with copy protection altogether. Cox argues that object-oriented programming (OOP) offers many improvements over conventional software, including more fluid applications and the ability to reuse modules of software. He proposes the idea of "superdistribution," which is similar to the balance of copyright and use rights in the music and radio industries. JEIDA, a Japanese consortium of computer manufacturers, has developed a chip and protocol that allows Macintosh computers to replicate software while metering use rights. Each time the software is used, it triggers a royalty. The concept of superdistribution, which involves the free dissemination of copies of digital content and payment only for what is used, is gaining popularity. This system relies on public-key encryption to keep counts private and untampered as they are transmitted to the credit center. Superdistribution makes software's ease of replication an asset and thrusts it out into the world to serve as its own advertisement. The Pay-Per-View Problem, where people are reluctant to pay for information they haven't seen, is usually solved with sampling or by lowering the price of admission. Information metering delivers two solutions: it provides a spigot to record how much data is used, and it provides a spigot that can be turned down to a cheap trickle. The fine granularity of information-metering allows for the trading of items that might not have been worth selling in any other kind of marketplace. The article discusses the potential for an electronically mediated marketplace that would deliver specific pieces of information for a reasonable price through encryption, allowing individuals to only pay for what they use. The founder of National Semiconductor, Peter Sprague, is leading this charge. The article also explores the concept of electronic cash, which is currently lacking in the information economy and network culture. While credit cards and ATMs offer a hint of digital cash, the full effects of an electronic economy will not be felt until everyday petty cash transactions of individuals go digital. Credit card companies are experimenting with card-based electronic money terminals, and Visa has issued over 20 million debit cards that deduct money from one's bank account. However, the conventional view of cashless money is not much more than an extension of the generic credit card system. The article discusses the drawbacks of debit or credit cards, including the lack of privacy, transaction costs, and limited usability. It suggests that true digital cash is a better alternative as it offers the nimbleness of electricity and the privacy of cash. Digital cash is real money that is accountable but unlinkable, and it does not require proprietary hardware or software. It can be used for any transaction, including person-to-person payments, and is fueled by encryption. The method, known as blinded digital signatures, is based on public-key encryption and allows for blind but verifiable transactions. Digital cash can replace every use of pocket cash except flipping a coin. The article discusses the rise of digital cash and smart cards, which offer privacy and agility in transactions. Smart cards contain a computer chip that holds a limited amount of cash, and they connect to an online computer when inserted into a slot. They are popular in Europe and Japan, where they are used for phone calls and even substitute for credit cards in Denmark. However, the popularity of smart cards in Denmark is overloading the banking system. David Chaum, a cryptographer, has proposed a solution to this problem: a distributed, true digital cash system that uses refillable smart cards and works offline. Chaum's interest in digital signatures began during his grad school thesis on fraud-proof electronic elections. David Chaum, a computer scientist, developed an encrypted cash system that provides anonymous electronic money, called digital cash. Chaum's digital cash offers privacy, as it allows merchants to receive payment without knowing the identity of the payer, and it works offline, making it perfect for small transactions. However, the smart-card version of digital cash is vulnerable to theft and loss, and cheating is possible if someone tries to spend the same money twice. Despite this, digital cash is untraceable except for cheaters. The Danish government is planning to switch from the Dencard to the Dencoin, an offline system suited to small change, due to its cheaper costs. David Chaum's digital cash system has a small computational overhead, with each transaction only consuming 64 bytes of data. The existing mainframe computers in banks would have more than enough computational power to handle digital cash, even if the system was scaled up. In addition to the offline system, people could also have computer appliances at home, loaded with digital cash software, which would allow them to pay others and get paid over phone lines. Banks are interested in digital cash, with corporate planners being more interested than lower-level systems guys. European city officials are eager customers for card-based digital cash, seeing it as the next step beyond magnetic fast-passes for public transportation. Chaum's larger agenda is providing tools for privacy in a networked world so that privacy can be balanced with security. The article discusses the potential for digital cash to transform the economy and society. Automatic toll systems that record car identities are already operating in some US states, and these systems could be modified to use untraceable encrypted payments. The same cash card that pays for public transportation could also be used to cover fees for private transportation, and this could lead to the adoption of digital cash for other uses. The article argues that digital cash will increase the velocity of money, allow for continuous-flow payments, and offer unlimited fungibility. These changes could have significant implications for the economy and banking industry. The article discusses the implications of the rise of e-money, which is highly malleable and can be used for a range of financial instruments. E-money can be used for private currencies and para-currency networks, which could potentially challenge the government's control over currency issuance. The article suggests that e-money will lead to the rise of underground economies and the blurring of lines between legal and illegal financial activities. Additionally, the article notes that the legality of anonymous digital cash is in limbo. The article discusses the potential for anonymous digital cash to become a reality in a cashless society. The author describes the possibility of transnational services issuing untraceable digital money and the potential for governments to require reporting of all financial transactions. The cypherpunks' mailing list maintainer, Eric Hughes, envisions multiple outlets for electronic money and the emergence of digital banks offering unreported transactions. Encryption technology is seen as a necessary counterforce to the Net's tendency to connect everything and everyone, and it is believed that encryption technology can civilize the avalanche of knowledge and data generated by networked systems. The article concludes that encryption permits the requisite out-of-controlness that a hive culture demands to keep nimble and quick as it evolves into a deepening tangle.
