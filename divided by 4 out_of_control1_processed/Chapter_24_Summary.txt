The Nine Laws of God are the principles that govern the creation of something from nothing, as observed from the frontiers of computer science, biological research, and interdisciplinary experimentation. These laws include distributing being, controlling from the bottom up, cultivating increasing returns, growing by chunking, maximizing the fringes, honoring errors, pursuing no optima, seeking persistent disequilibrium, and acknowledging that change changes itself. The principles are the broadest, crispest, and most representative generalities that can be found operating in systems as diverse as biological evolution and SimCity. These laws can be used to create complex systems that work, by assembling them incrementally from simple modules that can operate independently, and maximizing the fringes, where heterogeneity creates the world. The article discusses the principles of creating and sustaining complex adaptive systems. It argues that diversity, embracing errors, having multiple goals, seeking persistent disequilibrium, and recognizing the self-changing nature of change are essential for creating successful systems. The article emphasizes the importance of adapting to the world through daily minirevolutions rather than earth-shattering revolutions. It also highlights the significance of a healthy fringe, which speeds adaptation, increases resilience, and is almost always the source of innovations. The article concludes that evolution is about how an entity is changed over time, and deeper evolution is about how the rules for changing entities over time change over time. The principles of bio-logic, which underpin the workings of natural systems, are being implanted in artificial systems such as computer chips, electronic communication networks, and corporate management. This allows for the development of artifacts that can adapt, learn, and evolve, leading to a neo-biological civilization. In this future civilization, machines will become more biological, technological networks will make human culture more ecological and evolutionary, and biological ways will be revered as ideal. The coming era will be intensely biological due to five influences: organic life will continue to be the prime infrastructure of human experience, machines will become more biological, technological networks will become more ecological and evolutionary, engineered biology will eclipse the importance of mechanical technology, and biological ways will be revered as ideal. The future will see a vast ecology of computing devices in constant flux, and a world of mutating buildings, living silicon polymers, adaptable cars, and designer food crops. Life will subjugate technology and bring it under its reign of constant evolution, perpetual novelty, and an agenda out of human control.

The author reviews Kevin Kelly's book "Out of Control" and reflects on how hindsight allows us to edit and reduce the length of books, especially in the era of rapid electronic dissemination of data. The author also notes that books are still embedded in the cultural matrix of the technologies that created them and made them portable and cheap, despite the coming of e-books. The author reflects on the fast-paced nature of technological advancements and how quickly ideas become outdated. He highlights how new technologies are often overhyped and can lead us towards the edge of a cliff. The book "Out of Control" by Kevin Kelly is described as an update on the current state of cybernetic research and should be read as a part of intellectual history. The author notes that humans are always locked into the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The generational divide between those who grew up with the network and those who didn't is also discussed, with the younger generation being more accustomed to the network and having different experiences and expectations. The author suggests that the younger generation's astonishment will come from extraterrestrial contact and the exploration of other planets. Out of Control is a book by Kevin Kelly that explores new ways of constructing cultural lenses that will enable humankind to soar out of the deep cave of the earth into space. The book is encyclopedic in form and narrative structure, with interesting ideas and technologies, but lacking a new holistic vision. The concept of "emergent realities" is discussed, with Kelly noting that it is descriptive rather than explanatory and often used to escape real explanation. The book is a fun read but lacks depth. The article discusses the concept of "emergent reality" and the difficulty of defining and naming new ideas. It explores the limitations of traditional linear thinking and the ways in which digital thinkers approach non-linear systems. The author suggests that reality is subjective and shaped by culture and language. They use the example of communication technology to illustrate how our understanding of what is "real" is shaped by our experiences and internalizations. The article concludes by acknowledging the limitations of books and linear thinking but also recognizing their value in capturing and exploring ideas. The book "Out of Control" by Kevin Kelly attempted to define a new world before it was formed and provided insights and ideas about the interaction between technology and society. However, the book lacked perspective as the larger pattern it sought to create did not exist yet. The author argues that the idea of a piece of intellectual property written by an individual author is a wistful romantic idea that is no longer relevant in a world where individual identities merge into a collective identity. The new paradigm can only be understood after the shock of change is absorbed, and the complexities are nuanced. The book is a collection of snapshots taken by someone with a new digital camera, and while some are interesting, a shoebox full of glossy prints is not an art show. The author concludes that writing books like "Out of Control" is a challenge that we can't seem to resist, even though we know our inadequacy to define the bigger picture. The article discusses Kevin Kelly's "Nine Laws of God," which attempt to metatheorize natural and cybernetic creativity in his book "Out of Control." Kelly, the executive editor of WIRED Magazine, presents a techno-utopic vision of benevolent laissez-faire evolutionary and market forces. However, the article notes that there is little ethical reflection in Kelly's project, and if interpreted as natural law, his "Nine Laws" would suggest a more humble approach towards maintaining and encouraging cultural and ecological diversity. The breakdown of boundaries between the natural and the artifactual is seen as a problem and opportunity by Kelly. The article discusses Kevin Kelly's book "Out of Control" and his celebration of a "neo-biological civilization" where machines become biological and biology becomes engineered. However, the author poses an antithesis to Kelly's thesis, questioning the moral constraints on creativity and the dangers of being "out of control." The author suggests ethical constraints to limit Kelly's techno-utopic program for a WIRED world. The article introduces Kelly's background and his association with the Whole Earth Catalogue, which frames much of the discussion. Kelly's project is motivated by the idea of "getting-good-at-being-like-gods," but he also believes in the One God. The article discusses the conservative personal and social morals of Kevin Kelly, a member of Alma Heights Christian Fellowship and the executive editor of WIRED. WIRED is seen as the intellectual blueprint for the digital revolution, with its flashy graphics and success on the internet. The readership of WIRED is predominantly male with a high income and education level, and the magazine attracts substantial advertising revenue. The article questions the relationship between the magazine and Absolut Vodka, one of its most loyal advertisers. The article also describes the office of WIRED as a symbol of the bio-historical forces transforming the world. The article discusses Kevin Kelly's "Nine Laws of God," which he believes should guide human creativity in our neo-biological civilization. These laws are based on the principles of natural creativity and include concepts such as distributing being, controlling from the bottom up, and pursuing no optima. The author argues that these insights about biology and technology must serve as data in constructing postmodern natural theology and natural law ethics. The article also explores the emergent nature of social insects, such as bees, and their collective consciousness, which Kelly discusses in his book "Out of Control." The hive is referred to as a "superorganism" that exhibits emergent properties that cannot be inferred by studying individual bees. The text explores the concept of holism and swarm systems, drawing on the ideas of Kevin Kelly. It argues that complex systems, such as universities and the brain, are made up of many individual parts that work together to create a functional whole. Kelly's "Nine Laws" highlight the importance of distributing being and controlling from the bottom up. The text also discusses the role of coevolution, codependency, and obligated cooperation in nature and business, arguing that consciousness displays a nonlinear logic of perception and conception. However, the problem with swarm systems is that they cannot be controlled or predicted through linear models of causation. The author Kevin Kelly argues that consciousness, life, intelligence, and coevolution are the result of disequilibrium, which is a natural state of the universe and the Living Earth. He suggests that creativity is born out of disequilibrium and that change is good. Kelly explores new theories of ecology that conflict with traditional environmentalism's project of conserving undisturbed habitat. He believes that instability is the root of diversity and that humans are just a new phase of creative evolutionary instability. Kelly celebrates the emergence of the super hive mind of the Internet and the cashless society, and he is a free market optimist who believes in the Invisible Hand. However, he ignores questions of moral constraints and self-creative responsibility, and he advocates a laissez-faire social-techno-evolutionary nonpolicy. The article discusses the contrasting views of Kevin Kelly, who advocates for technological progress, and the author, who sees exponential growth as a problem. Kelly expresses contempt for environmentalists and believes that better technology is the solution to bad technology. However, the author argues that technology is more than just a thought and has real repercussions in the world. The exponential growth in population and consumption patterns is unprecedented in human history, and the economic idol of compounded interest may be akin to cancer within an organism. The collapse of human cultures and populations is not an abstract possibility for a third of the world, who struggle to survive malnourishment, disease, unemployment, cultural dislocation, and social unrest. The article explores the complexities of progress and suffering in the modern world, highlighting the success in reducing infant mortality rates but also the ongoing issue of poverty-related deaths in children. The author questions the confidence of some in avoiding economic, environmental, and social collapse, arguing that the planet is in a new chapter of evolution and facing nonlinear, swarm-like complexities. The article critiques Kevin Kelly's techno-utopic vision, arguing that it neglects the discussion of morality and is both anthropocentric and misanthropic. The author warns against a dangerous ideology of distributed beings without moral and political constraints. The article concludes that projections of post-apocalyptic fantasies are the mappings of present dysfunctions, not future scenarios. The article discusses Kevin Kelly's views on technology, nature, and humanity. Kelly believes that humans stand above nature and do not belong to it, and that our purpose is not rooted in the Divine incarnation in the evolutionary process, but in Divine and human transcendence of nature. He argues that technology is meant to allow humans to be creative and to understand the universe, not to worship nature. However, the article criticizes Kelly for not acknowledging the negative effects of technology on the environment and society. The author also questions Kelly's Christian beliefs, arguing that he lacks an appreciation for human evil and finitude. The article discusses the distribution of goodness and evil in the world and how it relates to the concept of God's creativity. The author argues that while evil and sin are nonlinear and complex, there are patterns that can guide us in our moral and spiritual lives. The article also explores the idea of humans as co-creators with God and the potential implications of neo-biological evolution. The author suggests that Kelly's philosophy of nature can be turned into natural ethics, which would lead to more conservative social and environmental policies that seek to preserve and enhance diversity and systemic processes. Overall, the article raises questions about the role of humans in the world and the relationship between God's creativity and our own. The author argues that to birth the new and the unexpected, one must surrender the seat of power to the mob below. The challenge is to follow Yahweh, who becomes the Lord God by giving up power but not responsibility. The author suggests that seeking creative tension and embracing ambiguities is essential in the journey of recovery into a neo-biological civilization. The synthesis is a real-time experiment with nature and culture, with science and religion that promises to transform the world and ourselves for better or worse in the coming years. The author also presents statistics on world population, world economic output, and fossil fuel consumption in 1900, 1950, and 1986. The author disagrees with some of Kevin Kelly's interpretations and clarifies that he asserts the reality of evil and original sin. However, the grand story is that good will triumph over evil. The article discusses Kevin Kelly's belief that the goodness of God is distributed throughout nature and not centralized in God. Kelly argues that the daily grind of people making hard choices of goodness is what leads to the triumph of good over evil. The article also briefly mentions Kelly's book "Out of Control," which discusses the benefits of swarm systems and the need to give up control in order to reap their benefits. In "New Rules for the New Economy," Kevin Kelly explores the counter-intuitive economic rules of the highly-connected network economy. Kelly weaves together ideas from "Out of Control" and applies them to the network economy, emphasizing the importance of decentralization, non-linear growth, plenitude, gift economies, devolution, and non-equilibrium working. He argues that efficiencies are for robots, while opportunities are for humans, and that waste presents opportunities for growth. Kelly's book offers an exhilarating ride through the possibilities of the network economy, but not everyone will realize its potential.
