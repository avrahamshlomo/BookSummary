The author finds himself in the university library searching for the work of Jorge Luis Borges. He discovers an anthology of interviews Borges did in his eighties, which contains an interview with Borges based on his writings in Labyrinths. In the interview, Borges describes a library that contains all possible books. The library is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with five shelves for each wall, and each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format. While most of the books are full of nonsense, there are a few books that make sense. Five hundred years ago, a chief of an upper hexagon discovered a book that had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines, which made it possible for a librarian to discover the fundamental law of the Library. The law states that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, and the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. From these premises, he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols. Therefore, any book that one could possibly write, in any language, could be found (theoretically) in the library. The text is a fictional conversation between the narrator and Jorge Luis Borges about the Library of Babel, a vast library containing all possible books. Borges describes the library as containing not only books of great beauty and insight but also false catalogues and useless books. He also mentions a sect of librarians who believed in eliminating useless books but argues that the reduction is infinitesimal. The narrator becomes tempted to find the best possible book he could write, entitled "Out of Control," in the library and sets off on a search. However, he finds only books filled with gibberish and nonsense. The narrator reflects on the design of the Library, which contains all possible books. Realizing that finding a readable book by random search would be miraculous, the narrator decides to search for books that are arranged by similarity. Using a search routine, the narrator finds books with increasing numbers of sensible English phrases until discovering a pattern of "good" books forming an image in their mind. This image represents a geography of coherence, with a single readable book residing on a summit's peak and lesser books forming rings of decreasing coherence below it. The narrator imagines this as a map of contour lines circling around a mountain. The narrator in "The Library of Babel" discovers a method to find coherent books in the vast, seemingly infinite library. The method involves climbing uphill, toward books with better grammar, until reaching the peak of a wholly grammatical book. Using this method, the narrator finds a book entitled "Hadal," but it is disappointingly bland. The narrator then discovers that the method is a variety of evolution, and that Borges's Library is real and can be accessed through silicon computer chips. All travelers arrive at the same Library, regardless of the means used to get there. The universality of Borges's Library of all possible books means that any computer can create a Borgian Library of all possible things. Karl Sims has created a Borgian Library of art and pictures using the Connection Machine 5 (CM5) and software he wrote. The CM5 can generate a vast universe of all possible pictures, just as it can generate a possible book. Sims uses the Method to walk through a Borgian Library of visual patterns and breed images. The mathematical logic of breeding pictures is indistinguishable from the mathematical logic of breeding pigeons. Sims and fellow computationalists call it artificial evolution. In Sims's universe, evolution has been yanked from the living world and left naked in mathematics. The article discusses the concept of artificial evolution, where the essence of evolution has moved from carbon to silicon, and it is fundamentally natural to computers. The author explores the idea of the Borgian universe, where the texts exist abstractly, independent of form, and each has an assigned spot on a virtual shelf. The author discusses Karl Sims, who breeds gray noise into jubilant images of plant life on the CM5, and how he evolved his way through the space, copying "seeds" of those forms he found most intriguing. The author also mentions Richard Dawkins, who invented a universe he called "Biomorph Land" in 1985, which is the space of possible biological shapes constructed with short straight lines and branches. Richard Dawkins created Biomorph Land, a computer program that generates tree-like shapes through selective breeding and artificial selection. The program draws a stick of a certain length and adds branches to it in a growth-like pattern, with values that can vary independently. Dawkins hoped to traverse a library of tree shapes by artificial selection and breeding. However, as he explored the program, he discovered a space in the library where the branching structures of his trees began to cross back upon themselves, forming little bodies rather than trunks. Auxiliary branches still sprouting from these bodies looked surprisingly like legs and wings, leading to the creation of complex insect-like creatures. Dawkins was astonished by the emergence of these creatures and spent hours exploring the extent of his universe. Richard Dawkins used a computer program called Biomorph Land to explore the possibilities of evolution. He discovered that by using the program's evolutionary method, he could breed shapes that resembled objects from the natural world and even letters of the alphabet. However, he struggled to recreate some of the shapes he had evolved, as the complexity of choices and subtle differences in the program's vast space made it difficult to deliberately relocate a point. The unpredictability of the program's monsters and the infinite number of possible pathways made it feel like wandering through a labyrinth. Despite this, Dawkins was haunted by the knowledge that the evolved forms existed somewhere in the program's Library. The text discusses two separate stories, one about a lost book of palindromes and the other about the search for a specific biomorph in Biomorph Land. The lost book of palindromes was discovered by the father of Jorge Luis Borges, but was lost in a fire and has been sought after by exlibrarians for generations. In a similar fashion, Richard Dawkins offered a prize for the rediscovery of a specific biomorph, which was eventually found by a software engineer. Dawkins had created a constrained embryology in Biomorph Land, which restricted the possibilities of forms to those that held biological sense and used recursive rules to produce complexity. He also introduced the idea of genes and bodies into the Library, with genes producing the tissues of the body. Richard Dawkins's computer program Biomorph Land used genes to control algorithms that drew images, resulting in a distillation of functional forms that could be manipulated through genetic engineering. Freelance knight of the Holy Grail Thomas Reed won Dawkins's $1,000 prize by using genetic engineering to find the "Holy Grail" image in the program. Other artists, such as William Latham and Karl Sims, also used the idea of computational breeding to create complex and evolving shapes. The visual nature of Biomorph Land made it appealing to artists, and the program's inherent grammar prevented the appearance of nonsensical forms. Artist and sculptor John Latham developed a tool called FormSynth, which he used to generate and select offspring forms for sculpture. He later turned to computing and collaborated with programmers to automate the process, creating the Mutator, which combined the evolutionary engine of Richard Dawkins with Latham's sophisticated 3D forms. The Mutator generated offspring forms with slight differences, which Latham selected and evolved over many generations to create a vast library of organic shapes that do not exist on Earth. Latham sought to create alternative organic forms that were more savage than those found in nature. His printouts possess a startling organic feel, resembling natural shapes but not copies of them. The Borgian Library contains all the forms of life, past, present, and future, including those on other planets. Evolution can be harnessed to explore the Library and create new forms that humans would never have thought of. Karl Sims and William Latham both used evolution to create new forms, with Sims using it to breed things he would never have thought of and Latham using it to explore forms beyond his imagination. Both Sims and Latham encountered difficulties in their explorations, such as hitting walls and experiencing plateaus in progress. They developed tricks to overcome these obstacles, such as purposefully twirling a mutation knob and using sex to drive variation. Overall, evolution serves as a tool to explore the vast possibilities of the Borgian Library and create new forms that would otherwise be inaccessible. The article discusses the various ways in which artificial evolution can be manipulated and controlled in a computer program. The program allows for different types of mating, including in-betweener and outsider offspring, as well as polygamy with up to five parents. The program also includes a Mutator that tracks the breeder's progress and makes certain genes dominant or recessive based on their persistence. The article concludes by discussing the potential for an artificial intelligence module to analyze a breeder's progress and retrieve a form that encapsulates a desired trait. The article discusses the use of computational evolution to create art and beauty. The author describes his experience using a program to breed images of flowers and the range of beautiful images that were produced. The creator of the program, Sims, believes that the data collected from museum visitors' choices of images can be used as a selection criteria for future breeding. However, the author suggests that the beauty of nature may reside in the process of evolution and the biological functionality of a form. The article also describes the development of a program called El-Fish, which allows users to breed virtual aquarium fish for aesthetic purposes. The program was developed by Russian programmers who rediscovered the power of computational evolution and created a commercial version for home computers. El-Fish is a computer program that allows users to breed and evolve virtual fish in a simulated underwater world. Users can select and breed parent fish, and adjust the mutation rate to create new offspring with increasingly ornate fins. The program stores the genes of the fish, called "roe," which can be shared with other users or stored in digital libraries. The program's limits are based on standard fish proportions, and users can test the boundaries by inserting text or data into the roe to create new, often bizarre fish. The program represents a new form of art, known as evolutionism, where artists use borrowed concepts of mutation and reproduction to evolve computer graphic models. The Texture Mutator is a tool for generating textures through exploratory evolution, which allows artists to create beauty through a system rather than analytical control. The artist acts as both a god and a gardener, creating a world and curating it. The next step in evolutionism is to begin with a human-designed pattern and then arbitrarily breed from there. The commercial software, DarwinDraw, allows users to sketch a new corporate logo and breed it to create an obsessively detailed evolved artwork with infinite resolution. IBM is exploring the potential of evolutionary design techniques for profitable projects, such as car body shapes and packaging design, and sees it as useful for all kinds of design problems entailing large numbers of parameters. Evolutionary industrial design is also perfectly suited to design by committee. The copyright status of artificially evolved creations is uncertain, as it is unclear whether the artist who bred or the artist who created the program should receive protection. In a large library of all possible creations, finding a specific one is equivalent to creating it. However, searching through such a library is difficult, as most items are full of noise and randomness. Evolution is a way to outsmart this problem, but intelligence is a tunnel through it. Some argue that thinking is a type of evolution of ideas within the brain, and all created things are evolved. The author discusses the process of writing a book, highlighting the seemingly infinite number of possible choices for each sentence. The author describes how they "evolved" their book by finding it in the Library of Borges, word by word. The satisfaction of the long search was that only the author could find their book.
