Biosphere 2 was a two-year closure experiment where eight humans, or biospherians, lived in a miniature surrogate Gaia. The experiment was plagued by insect infestations, and the biospherians lost weight due to their restricted diet. Some scientists felt that starting the project with humans inside was not the most productive way, and that the ecological study was pointless compared to the practical goal of developing technologies of human survival away from Earth. However, an independent Scientific Advisory Committee recognized that Biosphere 2 could contribute significantly to the understanding of biogeochemical cycles of closed systems and the knowledge and experience to maintain humans within equilibrium in a closed ecological system. The presence of humans was central to the experiment for the latter case, as they yielded a completely unexpected medical result. Regular blood tests of the biospherians showed increased levels of pesticides and herbicides in their blood, which the medics guessed was due to the biospherians burning up fat reserves stored in the past and flushing out toxins deposited in them decades ago. The Biosphere 2 experiment not only aimed to study the flow of pollutants through an ecosystem but also through a human body. The presence of humans in the closed ecosystem was justified by their ability to control and stabilize it, acting as copilots and keystone predators. The Biospherians spent several hours per day weeding and nudging the system away from disaster. However, the lack of turbulence was a missing ecological subsidy in Biosphere 2, as it is necessary for recycling nutrients and maximizing the productivity of a niche. Humans were responsible for creating miniturbulence, as it was an expensive resource to generate artificially. Turbulence was an essential catalyst in ecology, but it was not cheap to replicate in a man-made environment like Biosphere 2. The Biosphere 2 experiment aimed to create a self-sustaining environment, but the reality was complicated and expensive. The wave machine only produced small waves, and it was too expensive to create wind that could move pollen. However, life continued to thrive inside Biosphere 2, with many babies being born, but some species died out, including all the bumblebees and hummingbirds. The experiment also faced challenges from uninvited species, such as sparrows and passion vines. The modern world is fragmented, with urbanization leading to the rise of edge species that thrive on the borders of urban areas. The Biosphere 2 project was intended to test how a closed system coevolves, but the ecosystem inside the dome proved more tenacious than expected. Lynn Margulis predicted that the ecosystem would be overrun with Urban Weeds, but the human caretakers prevented this by selectively harvesting successful species. However, the ecosystem continued to push back, and the biospherians had to coevolve along with it. The coevolutionary world of Biosphere 2 was a test bench to find out how an environment governs the organisms immersed in it, and how the organisms in turn govern the environment. The Biosphere 2 experiment revealed surprising insights into the behavior of the atmosphere. The air inside the closed habitat was unexpectedly clean, thanks to a balancing mechanism, likely microbial. Carbon dioxide levels meandered up and down, with a high of 3,800 parts per million (ppm) during a sunless period. The biospherians worried that the increased CO2 in their air would harm the newly transplanted corals. The only measurement of any historical accuracy we have related to the Earth's atmosphere is carbon dioxide, which has been accelerating globally over the past 30 years, as measured by Charles Keeling. Keeling discovered that CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere cycles daily, increasing at night and hitting a low in the afternoon as plants turn CO2 into vegetables. The article discusses the work of scientist Keeling, who discovered three trends in the Earth's atmosphere: a hemispherical seasonal cycle of CO2, a global ambient CO2 level that rises each year, and an increasing amplitude of the seasonal cycle. The article also describes the Bio2 experiment, a miniature atmosphere/biosphere laboratory that can offer clues to the workings of the Earth's atmosphere. The fate of carbon in the Earth's atmosphere is a puzzle, with only half of the carbon burned by industrial humans remaining in the atmosphere as increased CO2 levels. Theories for the lost carbon include dissolution in the ocean, deposition in soils by microbes, and fueling growth of the world's savanna grass or tree wood. The article suggests that the Biosphere experiment is promising for gaining a better understanding of the global atmosphere. The Biosphere 2 experiment aimed to explore the links between an operating atmosphere and a living biosphere. The amounts of carbon in the atmosphere, soil, plants, and ocean were measured before closure, and the carbon was moved from air to living things through photosynthesis. Oxygen levels were lower inside Biosphere 2 than outside, and nobody knows why or how much oxygen is disappearing from the Earth's atmosphere. The biospherians also managed the atmosphere by deploying an "intentional season" to limit the rise of CO2. The experiment's contribution to science was generating big questions about Gaia and the atmosphere, and experts suggested tracing the comings and goings of atmospheric nitrogen, sodium, or phosphorus next. The Biosphere 2 experiment involved the manipulation of the atmosphere and ocean to create a self-sustaining closed system. The biospherians used a "molecule economy" to deposit and withdraw carbon from the atmosphere and created a carbon bank to store it. They made geological adjustments to the system to help it stabilize, but the many variables made it challenging. The goal was for the system to eventually "pop" into a stable state, similar to a saltwater fish tank. However, after two years, Biosphere 2 had not yet reached this stable state and required artificial nurturing to soothe its wild oscillations. The experiment demonstrated the complexity of creating a self-sustaining closed system and the importance of giving it time to mature. The Biosphere 2 experiment was an attempt to create a self-sustaining ecosystem within a closed environment. The experiment included a mechanical "technosphere" that supported the biological system and was an integral part of the greater organism. The technosphere was a scaffolding put in place to help the ecosystem reach a level of stability, and it included pipes, electrical wiring, workshops, motors, pumps, and fans. The nerve center of the system was the computer room that simulated every valve, pipe, and motor of the infrastructure. The Biosphere 2 experiment was an example of ecotech, the symbiosis of nature and technology. The experiment aimed to learn how to invent biomes without installing pumps and control the system by optimizing resource utilization. Biosphere 2 is a man-made ecosystem that serves as a laboratory for ecological experiments that require more control over the environment than can be achieved in the wild. It allows scientists to study individual species in a controlled environment and observe how they interact with each other. The project has three main purposes: to optimize production, to gain independence from technology, and to serve as a step towards space exploration. Biosphere 2 represents a planetary metamorphosis, where humans are involved in the reproduction of the Earth's biosystem. The project's success is measured by how long the biospherians can live inside it, but the ultimate goal is the reproduction of dwellings that recycle all that is needed for human life. The ecotechnicians who built Biosphere 2 have figured out the basic techniques for creating biospheres of any size. The author describes their experience of being alone in the Biosphere, a self-contained ecosystem built in the Arizona desert. They reflect on the importance of other life and the potential for engineered life to replace machines in the future. They believe that life is the ultimate technology and that it will continue to have its place even as machines become more organic and biological. The Biosphere is seen as a noble experiment that will teach us about the Earth and the uncountable other species we depend on. The author concludes that the glass spaceship parked in the desert is called a biosphere because the logic of the Bios runs through it. The merging of the organic and the mechanical is evident in the Biosphere 2, where the synthetic coral reef and the wave machine, waste-treatment marsh and toilet plumbing, and fans and soil bugs blur the line between the living and the manufactured. The author questions where one ends and the other begins, and suggests that a journey inside Biosphere 2 yields more questions than answers. The author concludes that spending two years in Biosphere 2 would feel like a lifetime.
