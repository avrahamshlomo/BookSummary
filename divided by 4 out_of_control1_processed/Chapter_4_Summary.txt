The article discusses the idea that the future of machines lies in biology, and that machines are becoming more alive than dead. The author visits a wildflower prairie that was recreated by Steve Packard, who had a dream to create a prairie oasis in the suburbs of Chicago. Aldo Leopold's successful recreation of a prairie in 1934 inspired Packard, who began working on his vision in 1974. The article argues that until Leopold's project, every step in civilization had been another notch in controlling and retarding nature, and that the future of machines lies in the tangled weeds underfoot. The article suggests that life is becoming manufactured, just as the manufactured is becoming life, and that both are becoming something wonderful and strange. The rebirth of the Curtis prairie, replanted with prairie species, was only a half-breed wilderness until the role of fire was rediscovered as a key ingredient to the prairie ecology. Aldo Leopold, the greatest American ecologist, initially argued against letting wildfire burn in wilderness but later conceded the vital nature of organic fire. The reintroduction of fire into the synthetic plots of the Wisconsin field grass arboretum caused the prairie to flourish like it had not for centuries. However, even after 50 years of fire and sun and winter snows, the Curtis prairie still suffers from invasions of monopolistic weeds. The Wisconsin experiment proved one could cobble together a fair approximation of a prairie, but it is unclear what it would take to make a pure prairie, an honest-to-goodness recreated prairie. The author visited a suburban Chicago woods where several hundred acres of rustling, wind-blown grass swept over their feet and under scattered oak trees, and the rediscovery of an entire lost ecosystem started with the "barrenness" of the ordinary-looking grass and trees. The article describes the restoration efforts of a man named Aldo Packard who attempted to recreate a prairie ecosystem in Illinois. Packard initially focused on planting prairie wildflowers and using fires to clear out non-native weeds, but after a few years, he realized that something was wrong. The plantings were not thriving and were being overtaken by brush. Packard eventually discovered that the missing ingredient was the presence of trees, and he began to focus on restoring a savanna ecosystem rather than a pure prairie. He collected seeds from various savanna-associated species and came to the realization that the system he was trying to restore was not just a prairie, but a prairie with trees. The pioneers in the Midwest called this type of ecosystem a "barren." The article discusses the restoration of a savanna barrens ecosystem in suburban Chicago by ecologist William Packard. The savanna barrens were dependent on fire, and when farmers stopped the fires, the ecosystem collapsed into a woods. Packard restored the ecosystem by sowing the mounds of mushy oddball savanna species, and within two years, the fields were ablaze with rare and forgotten wildflowers. The restoration led to the return of rare and endangered plants and animals, including the silvery-blue butterfly and the Edwards hairstreak butterfly. The article also discusses the importance of succession and the order in which pieces are added when restoring an ecosystem. Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee, compares succession paths to well-rehearsed assembly sequences that "the players have played many times." Ecologists Pimm and Drake conducted experiments to determine if a stable ecosystem could be assembled by taking in the parts at random. They created microecosystems by adding different pure strains of algae and microscopic animals to a large flask in various combinations and sequences. The resulting ecosystems were stable and self-reproducing, surprising the researchers. Pimm also created simplified ecological models in a computer to map how often a system would stabilize. His results showed that even with just 10 to 20 components in the mix, the number of stabilities could be in the tens, twenties, or hundreds. The system was sensitive to initial conditions, but it was usually attracted to order. The restoration of ecosystems requires more than just compiling a list of species present, it also requires understanding the assembly instructions for the ecosystem. Two examples of successful ecosystem restoration are Steve Packard's restoration of the Illinois prairie/savanna and David Wingate's restoration of the ecosystem of the subtropical island of Bermuda to save the cahow seabird from extinction. Wingate discovered that the cahow could not be saved without restoring the whole ecosystem. The restoration of ecosystems requires a careful understanding of the order of events and how each component of the ecosystem interacts with the others. The article discusses how ecosystems and other functioning systems can be destroyed much faster than they can be created. It takes time for nature to grow a forest or marsh. The author uses the example of a man named Wingate who created a temporary scaffolding to reestablish a lost ecosystem. He planted 8,000 cedar trees and a fast-growing non-native evergreen, the casuarinas, to act as a windbreak around the island. The resown forest made the perfect home for a night heron which had not been seen on Bermuda for a hundred years. The article also mentions Danny Hillis, an artificial intelligence expert, who sees a similar story in the human thumb as a platform for human intelligence. The article concludes with the heartwarming account of "The Man Who Planted Trees and Grew Happiness," which tells the story of a lone shepherd who spent his days planting acorns and, over three decades, had remodeled the local climate and restored the hopes of many thousands of people. The article discusses the concept of increasing returns in ecology, where the presence of certain species can create a positive loop of growth and development in an ecosystem. While there are examples of people successfully planting trees to recreate a forest environment, the article also highlights the potential challenges in restoring lost ecosystems due to the absence of key species. The Humpty Dumpty Effect refers to the difficulty in putting together a lost ecosystem if all the necessary pieces are not available. The article concludes that the growth of complex systems, whether mechanical or ecological, requires incremental and indirect approaches over time. The growth of computer networks and complex machines, such as robots and software programs, is similar to the growth of natural systems like prairies or tropical islands. These intricate constructions need to be assembled over time to ensure they work properly from top to bottom. Trying to replicate existing systems without recapitulating their growth from small networks will result in unripe machinery that is not fully integrated and diverse. Therefore, the process of creating complex machines will have to be gradual and involve diversity to ensure their reliability and functionality.
